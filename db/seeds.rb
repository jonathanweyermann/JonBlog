Roxy and I were handing out candy to the children coming to see santa. It was fun, but our feet were really cold, especially Roxy's. At least we got to move around a bit and warm up by the fire.&nbsp;I can't imagine how Santa must have felt.

  {title: "In search of an Android Wiki", category_id: 4, user_id: 1, tags: "Color Note, Pragmatic Thinking and Learning", body: "<p class=\"fr-tag\"><br></p><p class=\"fr-tag\">Having recently read <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-Wetware/dp/1934356050/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1425063431&sr=8-1&keywords=pragmatic+thinking+and+learning\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pragmatic thinking and Learning</a> by Andy Hunt, I realized I should try to find some way to build a personal wiki. A personal wiki can function like a mind map, and since links can go to anywhere, information doesn't have to be strictly hierarchical.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">I realized that one of the simple tools I already use,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.colornote.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Color Note</a>,&nbsp;is capable of creating links to other pages. To do it, you simply add [[ &nbsp;]] brackets around a string of text, and it instantly links to another page. If the page doesn't exist, Color Note will all you to create it once the link is clicked. This has encouraged me to reorganize colorNote.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">I've noticed that a windows 8 Metro version of Color Note has been released, which has helped made color note more useful for me, but I still wish there was a general web service for it. I realize there are other organizational tools, but I find Color Note the most useful, as its very quick to use, and has a good amout of versatility.</p>", image_file_name: "colornote-intro.png", image_content_type: "image/png", image_file_size: 135973, image_updated_at: "2015-03-13 03:34:03", state: 1},

While there is a lot of information in it, not everything will work for everyone. While I found the first sections, which talk about the drefus model, and how&nbsp;the brain works interesting, I found suggestions earlier in the book rather abstract and&nbsp;difficult to apply practically to my own life.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">In the second half of the book really has a great deal of practical tips, but you can't expect to retain everything in one reading. I found it helpful to make notes so I could go back and try to apply some of the techniques to my life. Andy explains SQ3R, a method of reading where you prepare yourself before you read in full. He explains how damaging context switching is, and explains ways we can minimize is. He is a big fan of mind-maps, and suggests the use of a personal wiki as an external storage space for your mind, something i'm attempting to do with <a href=\"13\">Color Note</a> at the moment. Even something like keeping a learning portfolio and treating it like a financial portfolio, where you invest time instead of money was interesting to me. While it seems like a no-brainer, the comparision made makes seem more important and urgent. The book is full of these moments where you get a new take on an idea, and I would recommend it for everyone, not just programmers.</p>", image_file_name: "pragmatic-thinking-and-learning1.jpg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 41965, image_updated_at: "2015-03-13 01:02:32", state: 1},
  {title: "Buildbox", category_id: 5, user_id: 1, tags: "Mobile, games, buildbox, graphics", body: "<p class=\"fr-tag\"><a href=\"http://www.buildbox.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Buildbox</a> is a tool designed to help you build a game from start to finish. Given the success of some of the more popular mobile games, it seems like an enticing idea.&nbsp;Having received a 15 day trail period of Buildbox, I spent a fairly significant chunk of time creating a game (according to my favorite time tracking app&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.teamviz.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">TeamViz</a>, i've dedicated 40 <a href=\"http://pomodorotechnique.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pomodoro</a>&nbsp;to it). While I did eventually create a game, and was fairly satisfied with the way it played, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chaosx.superduck&hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superduck</a>&nbsp;has yet to break 10 downloads on the Google Play Store. While I feel that my game felt like a fairly good game compared to a lot of what was out there, I came to realize that the axium of \"Build it and they will come\" is probably not true, and to be successful, I'd have to not only make good games, but learn to promote them well.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">As for buildbox itself, it delivers on what it promises, though the game feels like it has a bit of a blackbox feel, as the code seems inaccessible inside Android Studio. Thus there is always the feeling that something that could give the game a bit of an edge, such as leaderboards is not completely implementable.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">While buildbox has allowed its creators to put out some great games rather fast, their success with the games has a lot more to do with how they market them. The average joe creating his first game isn't to have nearly the same magintude of success. Still is a good experience though, but not one worth upwards of $2600.</p>", image_file_name: "buildboxlap.png", image_content_type: "image/png", image_file_size: 220227, image_updated_at: "2015-03-13 02:05:05", state: 1},
  {title: "The importance of bounded time", category_id: 4, user_id: 1, tags: "pomodoro, time management", body: "<p class=\"fr-tag\">Even since I've started using the <a href=\"http://pomodorotechnique.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pomodoro</a> technique, I feel like my productivity has increased greatly. For those who don't know, a pomodoro is a bounded unit of time, during which one is to do their best not to get distracted. It is a unit of work during which checking your e-mail is a no-no. Pomodoro is the italian word for tomato, because the technique was orignially applied using a tomato timer. Typically the pomodoro interval is 25 minutes, with a 5 minute break, and a 15 minute break after 4 pomodoro.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">The idea is that bounding your time helps increase productivity. This is based on parkinson's law, which states that t<span>he demand on a resource tends to expand to match the supply of that resource. When applied to time, it means that any project, regardless of how complex, will expand to fill in the allotted time. Time will get taken up due to unnecessary revising and reediting, or most likely because of procastination. A project with a long deadline doesn't appear very urgent, and thus we're unlikely to tackle it until that deadline is looming.</span></p><p class=\"fr-tag\">For me, it often helps to get over a hump. When I dread a task, using the promodoro technique can encourage me to get started, as I know that after 25 minutes I can have a break. Often by then I'm totally into my work, and don't need it. I find it's helpful to have a way to not only track the 25 minute intervals, but to add them up and record them. My favorite tool for this task is <a href=\"17\">Teamviz</a></p>", image_file_name: "Il_pomodoro.jpg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 324967, image_updated_at: "2015-03-13 03:01:18", state: 1},
  {title: "TeamViz", category_id: 5, user_id: 1, tags: "time management, productivity, recording", body: "<p class=\"fr-tag\">TeamViz is by far my favorite time management tool. At the very basic level it is a <a href=\"16\">pomodoro</a>&nbsp;tracking tool. It even sounds like a tomato timer. But it's so much more than that. It allows you to plan tasks in multiple categories&nbsp;and split them into Pomodoro. It allows you to assign an estimated number of pomodoro to a task which you can change at any time. Unlike other pomodoro tools i've tried, it doesn't try to limit your pomodoros per task to 6 or 7 before splitting it up, and this gives a lot more flexibility if you wish to group certain kinds of tasks into one.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">Another thing I love about it is the reports feature. It allows one to review the number of pomodoros done in the past, and shows a very pretty graph. There is limit to far back you can go, and it is thus easy to assess and track your progress.&nbsp;It encourages me to try for more pomodoro to break previous weekly or daily records.&nbsp;A key feature of the pomodoro is that distracting thoughts or tasks are to be written down for later, and teamviz allows for that as well.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Ariel, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 19.6000003814697px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);\">TeamViz is not without some faults however. The most glaring is that the android version is completely unreliable. Typically it will crash before the timer is up, and thus i've given up its use altogether. The desktop version are generally stable, but they do have the occasional graphical glitch. For instance, the program can't display pomodoro past 99 on the main interface window, and the rows of pomodoro on the timer window tends to run off the screen.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Ariel, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 19.6000003814697px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);\">Nevertheless, it is the best combined pomodoro/overall project tracker that i know of. Typically it takes two programs to accomplish what TeamViz does, and I find that too cumbersome to be practical.</span></p><p class=\"fr-tag\">At this point all the features seem to be free, although the <a href=\"http://www.teamviz.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">company website&nbsp;</a>states that the synchronization is actually $1.99 a month. If this ever got enforced, I would have to upgrade, as its a must have feature, as TeamViz runs on all of my computers, on both windows and ubuntu, and without the synchronzie feature it would lose a lot of its appeal.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><br></p>", image_file_name: "TeamViz.png", image_content_type: "image/png", image_file_size: 256144, image_updated_at: "2015-03-13 03:30:04", state: 1},
  {title: "Dream Trainer Ruby App", category_id: 5, user_id: 1, tags: "Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Rails, App, learning, training, quizzes", body: "<p class=\"fr-tag\">My work for the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.edmontondreamcentre.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Edmonton Dream Centre</a>, and a course on Technology for Teachers&nbsp;inspired me to try to build an educational platform that would function both as a testing tool and a learning platform. While quiz-making apps exist, most do not support the creation of even rudimentary learning modules. Even educational tools typically cater more to Quizzes (for instance<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.socrative.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Socrates</a>), or more on learning content, at the expense of testing (<a href=\"https://www.blendspace.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blendspace</a><span>&nbsp;</span>comes to mind).</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">The Dream Trainer is an attempt to combine both learning modules and testing (multiple choice, for now) in a single web interface. While designed for the Edmonton Dream Centre, it will be made available to the public as well.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">Unlike more open platforms like<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Udemy</a>, Students or Employees (leaners) will only be able to participate through an invite from an instructor, making it ideal for a classroom or a business where information should not be made available to the public. Each instructor will have their own private space to create modules and quizzes, and the people he invites will be able to view only the one instructor's material.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><br></p><p class=\"fr-tag\">The app is made with ruby on rails, and is available at trainer.jonathanweyermann.com</p>", image_file_name: "China.png", image_content_type: "image/png", image_file_size: 538217, image_updated_at: "2015-03-13 04:42:18", state: 1},
  {title: "Five ways of Beating Procrastination", category_id: 4, user_id: 1, tags: "procrastination, putting it off", body: "<p class=\"fr-tag\"><strong><span style=\"line-height: 19.6000003814697px;\">1) Eliminate distractions</span></strong></p><p class=\"fr-tag\">For me this involved conciously blocking some website on my installed browsers. While I put this off for a long time, because I convinced byself I would merely circumvent the block when I wanted to view the site, this really helped. Somehow having the site return as blocked was enough to snap me back to what I needed to do. Keep your PC work environment clear of distracting programs you should not be using, and make them more difficult to access. Surprisingly, its much easier to convince your mind to not do something if you add extra steps required to do it.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><br></p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><strong>2) Make Lists</strong></p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><span>A list of tasks with an approximate timeline will encourage you to stay on task</span>If you don't have something specific you wish to accomplish in a particular time, its easy to get distracted. As David Allen explains in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1426647181&sr=8-1&keywords=getting+things+done\" rel=\"nofollow\">Getting Things Done</a>,&nbsp;it's helpful to break down goals to the next Actionable step, the next action you have to take to complete a task.. Its important to be realistic, but not be too forgiving with time allocated to tasks, or you will doddle.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><br></p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><strong>3) Limit&nbsp;Time</strong></p><p class=\"fr-tag\">Use the <a href=\"16\">Pomodoro Technique</a>, or something similar to set a time window where you will commit to being completely focused. Any distracting thought that comes to mind should be recorded for later, not acted upon. You lose tremendus productivity by context switching</p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><br></p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><strong>4) Remove Automated Distractions</strong></p><p class=\"fr-tag\">Unless the work involves your Email, do not check E-mails between bounded time windows, and don't have your Email client automatically refresh incoming mail. Turn off social networks, or anything else that automatically interrupts and distracts</p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><br></p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><strong>5) Keep it simple</strong></p><p class=\"fr-tag\">Don't try to make time management too fancy. If you system has too much overhead, it will reduce productivty and be tedious. Also, stick with your system, and don't try to reinvent it every week. There is a point where looking for new productivity hacks becomes a way to procastinate.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><br></p>", image_file_name: "Procastination.jpg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 199098, image_updated_at: "2015-03-18 03:33:01", state: 1},
