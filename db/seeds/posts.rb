While there is a lot of information in it, not everything will work for everyone. While I found the first sections, which talk about the drefus model, and how the brain works interesting, I found suggestions earlier in the book rather abstract and difficult to apply practically to my own life.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">In the second half of the book really has a great deal of practical tips, but you can&#39;t expect to retain everything in one reading. I found it helpful to make notes so I could go back and try to apply some of the techniques to my life. Andy explains SQ3R, a method of reading where you prepare yourself before you read in full. He explains how damaging context switching is, and explains ways we can minimize is. He is a big fan of mind-maps, and suggests the use of a personal wiki as an external storage space for your mind, something i&#39;m attempting to do with <a href=\"http://www.jonathanweyermann.com/posts/in-search-of-an-android-wiki\">Color Note</a> at the moment. Even something like keeping a learning portfolio and treating it like a financial portfolio, where you invest time instead of money was interesting to me. While it seems like a no-brainer, the comparision made makes seem more important and urgent. The book is full of these moments where you get a new take on an idea, and I would recommend it for everyone, not just programmers.</p>", image_file_name: "pragmatic-thinking-and-learning1.jpg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 41965, image_updated_at: "2015-03-13 01:02:32", state: 1, publish_date: nil, slug: "pragmatic-thinking-and-learning", job_priority: 1},

Given the success of some of the more popular mobile games, it seems like an enticing idea. Having received a 15 day trail period of Buildbox, I spent a fairly significant chunk of time creating a game (according to my favorite time tracking app <a href=\"http://www.teamviz.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">TeamViz</a>, i&#39;ve dedicated 40 <a href=\"http://pomodorotechnique.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pomodoro</a> to it). While I did eventually create a game, and was fairly satisfied with the way it played, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chaosx.superduck&hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superduck</a> has yet to break 10 downloads on the Google Play Store. While I feel that my game felt like a fairly good game compared to a lot of what was out there, I came to realize that the axium of &quot;Build it and they will come&quot; is probably not true, and to be successful, I&#39;d have to not only make good games, but learn to promote them well.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">As for buildbox itself, it delivers on what it promises, though the game feels like it has a bit of a blackbox feel, as the code seems inaccessible inside Android Studio. Thus there is always the feeling that something that could give the game a bit of an edge, such as leaderboards is not completely implementable.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">While buildbox has allowed its creators to put out some great games rather fast, their success with the games has a lot more to do with how they market them. The average joe creating his first game isn&#39;t to have nearly the same magintude of success. Still is a good experience though, but not one worth upwards of $2600.</p>", image_file_name: "Buildbox.jpg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 86475, image_updated_at: "2017-12-02 22:56:29", state: 1, publish_date: nil, slug: "buildbox", job_priority: 1},

  {title: "Creating a nested comment system in Ruby on Rails", category_id: 8, user_id: 1, tags: "Ruby on Rails", body: "<p>One of the most classic things to build in Ruby on Rails is a blog app. In fact, this site is built with Ruby on Rails. Each blog Post object instance can have multiple Comments attached to it. While this is very simple and functional, comments on blogs often have additional functionality: The ability to respond to a specific comment, and thus create a nested comment structure. Thus I&#39;ve recently begun exploring how I could add this to my own blog. Here are my results:</p><pre><code>class PostsController &lt; ApplicationController\r\n  expose :post, find_by: :slug\r\n  expose(:posts) { <code>Post.public</code> }\r\n  expose(:user) { post.user }\r\nend\r\n</code></pre><p>This is my PostsController. It uses <a href=\"https://github.com/hashrocket/decent_exposure\">Decent Exposure</a> to simplify the controller actions. On this controller, there are show and index actions, but they&#39;re not explicitly written out because the expose applies to all controller actions. The post uses <a href=\"https://github.com/norman/friendly_id\">Friendly Id</a> to show by slug not not by id (for prettier urls), and therefore I&#39;ve set the post to find_by slug. posts is for the index view, and public is a method in the post model that determines which posts should be shown (in my case, based on a specific date, and whether I&#39;ve set them to published).</p><p><br></p><pre>class CommentsController &lt; PostsController\r\n\r\n  def create\r\n    comment = post.comments.create(comment_params)\r\n\r\n    if comment.valid? &amp;&amp; comment.save\r\n      flash[:notice] = &#39;Comment Added&#39;\r\n      session.delete(:comment)\r\n      redirect_to post_path(post, anchor: &#39;comment&#39;)\r\n    else\r\n      session[:comment] = comment\r\n      flash[:alert] = Array(comment.errors).to_sentence\r\n      redirect_to new_post_comment_path(post, comment_id: params[&quot;comment&quot;][&quot;reply_comment&quot;], anchor: &#39;comment&#39;)\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  private\r\n\r\n  def comment_params\r\n    params.require(:comment).permit(:name, :email, :body, :post_id, :reply_comment)\r\n  end\r\nend</pre><p>The comments controller inherits from the post controller (the comments are also route nested beneath the posts ).

  {title: "The easiest ways to make money", category_id: 7, user_id: 1, tags: "", body: "<p>While most of us trade our time for money, and this can be fairly effective, and does scale as you become more skilled at something, the easiest way to make money is to have an income producing asset that makes money for you. When it comes to income producing assets however, there is usually a great deal of capital required to make things work. It takes money to make money passively, but if you&#39;re willing to add some of your own effort to the mix, such as owning a business or a rental property, your return on capital can be greatly increased. Whether your can take those routes depends on your available time and willingness to put effort in. The way I look at it, there are really 3 major ways to make an income, and each has their own pros and cons</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1) Working for someone else</strong></p><p>The pros of this is that the barrier to entry is the lowest. It doesn&#39;t require any capital inputs, but typically requires you to possess some form of useful skill or demonstrate a capability in something. For this category, degrees and diplomas are useful, as they signal value to an employer, even if the direct skills required are lacking. The range of pay is variable, but is typically a multiple of the amount of hours worked, and grows moderately slowly with age and experience. &nbsp;Top performers who are able to distinguish themselves sometimes command much higher salaries because their skills are in high demand, though this typical requires branching out and carving your own career path has a freelancer or consultant.</p><p>I would also lump participating in the sharing economy here, as typically an individual still ends up working in some way for the business coming up with the concept, ie Uber.</p><p><strong>2) Running a business</strong></p><p>This requires a variable amount of capital input and a variable amount of work. The amount of income that can be generated varies widely and can grow exponentially, especially since one can hire others to scale. However, making money initially is much more difficult, and requires a great deal of work to get going. It&#39;s much easier to buy a business that&#39;s already operational. While it requires work, there will already be revenue coming in, and the business will have its clients and employees(depending on the business) already. Typically purchasing established businesses is very capital intensive though. When buying something traditional like real estate however, much of the money can easily be borrowed from the bank in the form of a mortgage. This is really what gives you a great return if you can find an ideal building: Leverage. The return on your own money can be quite high if you can get positive cash flow after your costs are paid for.&nbsp;</p><p>For the purchase of non-traditional businesses, &nbsp;like a website, the returns could be higher, &nbsp;as are the risks, and it might be difficult to find a traditional lender. Thus you may have to out up a lot of your own capital. However, depending on the site, it could scale much better than real estate, potentially acquiring more users without much more work on your behalf. However, you may require additional capital for more advertising, and profit is not guaranteed.

You can avoid paying taxes on your returns if you use designated retirement or saving accounts, &nbsp;such as TFSA&#39;s and RRSP&#39;s in Canada, &nbsp;or Roth IRA and traditional IRA in the US. Beyond that you&#39;ll have to pay taxes on any gains you make. It is the safe, &nbsp;slow and most secure way to be wealthy. It requires that you make frequent contributions over a long period of time, typically for many years, until you&#39;re financially independent, and have enough to no longer rely on employment.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Most of us will participate on some combination of the above, with various success.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><table><thead><tr><th>Method of Income</th><th>Capital Required</th><th>Personal time Required</th><th>Difficulty</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Working for someone else</td><td>None</td><td>moderate to high</td><td>easy</td></tr><tr><td>Running a business</td><td>Varies greatly on the business</td><td>varies, typically higher that being an employee, at least initially</td><td>difficult&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Investing&nbsp;</td><td>High amount of capital required to live off of</td><td>Almost none</td><td>easiest</td></tr></tbody></table>", image_file_name: "5856660723_ef2b89a8e6_b.jpg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 478401, image_updated_at: "2018-04-02 01:55:59", state: 1, publish_date: "2018-04-03 00:00:00", slug: "the-easiest-ways-to-make-money", job_priority: 4},
  {title: "Why Cloudmining with Hashflare is inadvisable", category_id: 7, user_id: 1, tags: "", body: "<p>With the rise cryptocurrency and the inevitable mining people may be tempted to get involved in, nothing seems more tempting that cloud mining for Bitcoin or Ethereum. The promise is seems to be that you can get a year of Cloudmining Bitcoin and make your money back in two months, and everything after that is profit. The issue that is not mentioned is that mining difficultly always increases. Historically, even in years where bitcoins in didn&#39;t appreciate in price, mining difficultly nevertheless increased. Mining difficultly is based on the amount of Bitcoin being minded, and merely will always increase the as the capabilities of mining hardware increases relative to their costs. There is no reason to believe this increase will slow down in the future. Even with the price of Bitcoin being relatively high compared to the difficulty, companies like Hashflare simply raise prices until it&#39;s practically assured that whatever you&#39;re paying them to mine will always buy more Bitcoin at the moment you pay for it, than will be mined.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall you are likely to make money, but less than if you had simply purchase the Bitcoin to begin with. While you could possibly be OK with this arrangement, as you&#39;re not losing money, it&#39;s not as if it protects you in any way if the price of Bitcoin were to crash, for instance. This is because difficulty depends more on the power of the underlying hardware used for mining. If the price were to lower at this point, it would only if it crashed to the point were mining on otherwise profitable hardware become unprofitable. Much of the mining cost is sunk hardware costs, with an Antminer S9, still one of the most popular new miner sold, costing around $8000 CAD, and it&#39;s electricity costs at 1300w and 10c/kwh being around $1100, the price of bitcoin would have to go to below $2000 USD a coin until it was no longer profitable to mine it at current difficulties. When looking at a difficulty chart between early December 2017 and early January 2018, the price of Bitcoin makes no new highs, but when looking at the difficult in that time, it still increases almost 50%. As long as it makes sense to bring new mining hardware online, the difficulty will increase.</p><p>Further, &nbsp;even Cloudflare, &nbsp;the most &#39;reputable&#39; of the cloud miners, will change the terms of service at a whim if it looks like the miner might win out. In the past, &nbsp;they cut the length of already existing contracts from five years to one, when the difficulty hadn&#39;t climed fast enough for their liking. They raise prices per hash on new contracts with the price of Bitcoin, even though their costs per hash should be decreasing as better hardware comes available. Plus, there are maintenance fees that they could change at a moment&#39;s notice. Seemingly the only way to make real profit mining is to get your own Antminer S9 or similar mining machine. Hoping to make a profit beyond what you would have made with merely buying the coin with cloudmining seems to be a pipedream, and if it is possible, vendors will just raise prices until it&#39;s not possible. In theory, I believe both the cloud mining companies and their customers should be able to benefit and make profit past their original investment, but in practice the cloud mining vendor holds all the cards, and due to high demand regardless of what they do, they have no incentive run an honest business and allow their customers to actually make profit. Now, they won&#39;t technically run away with your initial investment not pay you out if you cash out, because they don&#39;t need to: They&#39;re continuously tilting the odds in their favour.</p>", image_file_name: "hashflare-cloud-mining-review.jpg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 147498, image_updated_at: "2018-03-12 22:34:10", state: 1, publish_date: "2018-03-13 00:00:00", slug: "why-cloudmining-with-hashflare-is-inadvisable", job_priority: 5},
  {title: "Getting out of debt advice", category_id: 7, user_id: 1, tags: "debt", body: "<p>As a blogger whose focus is at least partially on personal finance, I&#39;m often hesitant to touch this topic because it seems so obvious to me. However, since many people struggle with this, and people like Dave Ramsey have made fortunes on telling people out of debt, I suppose I should try to at least tackle the issue at some level, mostly because it&#39;s extremely difficult to invest and and build personal wealth when debt when one has debt. Now when I&#39;m talking about debt i&#39;m not referring to your 3-4% interest a year mortgage. That hardly counts, because when one looks at historical stock markets returns it&#39;s practically free money, and you should hang onto it for a while, assuming you&#39;re willing to invest additional mortgage payments instead. However, if you&#39;ve already maxed out your tax-free accounts, and the interest rate higher than 4%, it could be arguable something sensible to do. That said, this is a debt post and assumes you&#39;re not swimming in money.</p><p>The debt i&#39;m referring to is credit card debt, and high interest student loan debt, and any other debt where in interest rate is in excess of 6% a year. While it&#39;s always better not to get into this kind of debt in the first place (don&#39;t spend money you don&#39;t have), in case of student loans it may be somewhat unavoidable. If you&#39;re piling on student load debt, I would still recommending working hard during your summers, and being conservative in your spending (the student load isn&#39;t free money), even if you&#39;d have loans regardless.</p><p>For those with credit card debt, I simply don&#39;t understand. I&#39;ll say this once: You have a flaming emergency. A credit card works best when you pay it off at the end of every month. It&#39;s not some sort of additional bank account you can spend as you wish. If you use it like that, and make only minimum payments, you will find yourself in a world of hurt. This isn&#39;t an efficient way to increase your purchasing power, but ensures you pay more in the long run for everything. I&#39;m not sure how to put this more simply. Credit cards will not make up for an income shortfall, but will make the shortfall worse. If you have an income shortfall, the only solution is to make more money or spend less, using a credit cards on exasperate the problem.</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t even think about making a budget if I had credit card debt. I just try to separate my needs from my wants, and don&#39;t buy things I don&#39;t need. Needs and wants are easy to separate. It&#39;s a need if you can&#39;t replace it with a cheaper substitute. New clothing is not a need, a new car is not a need, eating out is not a need, cable is not a need, home internet, computers and iphones are not a need. There are many very functional unlocked smartphones for around $100, and you could access the Internet at the library too. Living on your own is not a need; get a roommate or rent out a room if you have to, or find somewhere cheaper to live. Now, how far you want to take this will depend on your own situation, but regardless of how far, I just want to get into your mind that holding a credit card balance month over month is an emergency situations that you can&#39;t just hope to resolve by itself. It&#39;s going to take lifestyle changes, sacrifices, because if it didn&#39;t, you wouldn&#39;t be in debt in the first place. You may also have to take on additional work, whether its a part time job, working overtime hours, or finding a sharing economy gig, like being an Uber driver</p><p>After you get a paycheck you should take care of your needs first, by paying your bills you will be required to pay before the next paycheck arrives. Then you should pay off as much as you can on your credit cards, leaving just enough in your bank account to satisfy any needs you expect unfulfilled. Use a debit card to spend for needs, and a credit card only in an emergency. Don&#39;t bother trying to have an emergency fund if you still have credit card debt. Even a $1000 emergency fund could cost you $200 a year in interest.&nbsp;</p><p>Other options: switching to a credit card with temporarily low fees. Credit card companies will sometimes give you an interest free credit card for a number of months to switch to them. This could save you hundreds if not thousands in interest. Don&#39;t treat this as free money, you just bought yourself some time, but you still have an emergency. Watch out for transfer fees though and make sure it&#39;s worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Another possibility is to refinance your credit card into your line of credit if you have one, or do some other kind of debt consolidation. While the interest rates are lower, you should have some sort of realistic repayment plan so you don&#39;t find yourself in the same situation again.</p><p>If you really have problem with the credit card spending, and you can&#39;t seem to not abuse it, you may be better off just saving an emergency fund first and cutting up your credit card, (all other steps are the same), even though it&#39;s not financially optimal.</p>", image_file_name: "debt-min.jpg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 41178, image_updated_at: "2018-01-28 20:49:22", state: 1, publish_date: "2018-03-06 00:00:00", slug: "getting-of-debt-advice", job_priority: 3},

  {title: "Should you invest in Cryptocurrency?", category_id: 7, user_id: 1, tags: "", body: "<p>With the rapid ascent in the dollar value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, most investors must be asking themselves if they should invest in Cryptocurrencies, &nbsp;or if they&#39;ve missed the boat. With the more than 20 fold growth of Bitcoin, the common sentiment must be that this can&#39;t continue to go on like it has.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">It&#39;s difficult to predict which currencies will win out in the end, mostly because technical superiority and usability as a currency of exchange are not the only factors in the uptake of a currency, but also mind presence. </span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Better known currencies have an advantage because more people wish to invest in them, driving the price higher. They also draw more developers to them, increasing their capabilities, &nbsp;and thus it seems like being first (ie. &nbsp;Bitcoin) &nbsp;is a significant advantage. </span></p><p>While the overall trend of these currencies is up, &nbsp;sometimes sharply so, due to the limited amount that can be mined, this trend seems far too aggressive with Bitcoin. With almost 80% of all Bitcoins mined, and those remaining exponentially more difficult to mine, Bitcoin is a very scarce commodity. It seems that at least until some saturation point is reached, the long term trend can only be up.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, there are lots of risks. There seems to be a big chance that one currency could outgrow all the others. &nbsp;While currently Bitcoin has the largest market cap, &nbsp;Ethereum has been gaining ground. There is the chance that cryptocurrencies could get crushed by new regulations. Further, the currencies have no intrinsic value, and will ultimately have to actually be useful in the real world. If the only use is speculation and money laundering and other illegal activities, and illegal activity gets rooted out and crushed, the demand may drop. They are certainly a very volatile investment.</p><p>That said, I&#39;d recommend investing a smaller but consistent amount in various currencies. To do this, I&#39;d sign up with Coinbase, purchase Etherium and send it to an exchange. I currently use Binance.com, but you can use any exchange. From there, various currencies can be purchased. I&#39;d spread my money around and buy as many as you can, adding to my positions every time I add more money. You can use a rebalancing methodology where you sell some of the overperformers and add to underperformers, though they tend to grow very irreguarly, so you may be better off holding into a winner for a while.</p><p>With Altcoins, there are definitely some pitfalls to avoid. Some are outright scams, but it may be a while before this is discovered. Usually, this will cause the price to unrecoverably collapse. It&#39;s best to try to vet the coin before your put your money down. At the very least you should do a Google search or two. This will at least allow you to avoid coins that have already been flagged as scams, &nbsp;lest you be tempted to purchase a high number of inexplicably cheap coins.</p><p>The price of these coins are easily manipulated by pump and dump groups, and can easily grow in the hundreds of percent in a day, and often fall just as fast. It&#39;s best not to purchase too many coins in response to sudden price increases, as these rapid rallies often don&#39;t last. An exception may be when coins first hit an exchange. That said, pre-ico sales on some coins have been giving out a great deal of extra coins, so much so that they&#39;re sometimes dumped when they hit an exchange driving the price below the ico price.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, Altcoins are a very risky investment with potentially great rewards and huge price fluctuations. They are one of the very few ways a retail investor can get in on the ground floor of a startup. That said, almost anyone can do an ico, and scams are everywhere. Regardless, I would avoid buying a lot at once (if you use coinbase with a credit card you will have limits to keep you from overspending). This will force you to cost average and prevents you from buying a lot at the top.&nbsp;</p>", image_file_name: "untitled-design5.jpg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 108352, image_updated_at: "2018-01-17 19:42:58", state: 1, publish_date: "2018-02-06 00:00:00", slug: "should-you-invest-in-cryptocurrency", job_priority: 5},
  {title: "6 Investment mistakes to avoid", category_id: 7, user_id: 1, tags: "", body: "<p>Each one of these are mistakes that have cost me various amounts of money over the course of my life. If I could impart onto you some things not to do when investing, this would be some things from my experience.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">1) Putting all your eggs in one basket</span></strong></p><p>Before the financial crisis, real estate in Alberta was booming, and my Dad and I were trying to get a piece of the action. Not really understanding enough about the company we were investing with, we made a real estate investment that involved developing some land in the Crowsnest Pass to be vacation real estate. While this investment had many problems in retrospect (the Crowsnest Pass is not the hotbed of tourism as places actually in the rockies, the company was a ponzi scheme which took investor&#39;s money and funneled it to previous projects which were not paid for yet, and that vacation real estate is highly volatile), the biggest problem is entirely of our own making. We invested far too much of our assets into a single investment. The promised returns were good, but many businesses lent to by <a href=\"http://www.jonathanweyermann.com/posts/10\">lending loop</a> offer very similar returns, and you can diversify your investments among many businesses. We were pretty much going all in, and we lost nearly everything.</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">2</span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">) Chasing the daily returns of the forex or stock market</span></strong></p><p>No matter which secret formula I purchased from so-called gurus, I couldn&#39;t successfully make profits chasing the markets using technical indicators. Perhaps there are some who can, but it&#39;s a lot harder than it looks. If someone could teach it you using a couple indicators for $49, or even $1049, almost anyone could do it. For a while I bought various systems to try to trade, and all I was doing was spending money on systems and losing money in trading accounts</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">3) purchasing automatic trading tools</span></strong></p><p>Again, if there was a way to consistently profit in the stock market, using binary options, or forex (foreign exchange), would someone really sell it to you for $149? Most robots are scalpers or martingale systems, which often appear to make small profits, but will eventually take massive losses in the long term. Making a successful automated system isn&#39;t easy, as adding more rules (just like in any trading system) doesn&#39;t necessarily make the system better. Markets change too, and what was successful in the past often doesn&#39;t work today. If someone offers you a system that guarantees automatic profits, run away as fast as you can.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">4) Buying or selling options ahead of company earnings to make quick profits</span></strong></p><p>Trading options for a such a short term window is highly speculative. Options can be part of balanced portfolio to hedge losses, and can be used to increase your trading leverage over the medium to long-term, but the movement of stock after earnings can be highly irrational. Stocks can move down on good news, for instance. Often purchasing options can produce losses if the stock doesn&#39;t move far enough in the desired direction, as the volatility decreases after the earning announcement, making the option much less valuable. Selling option can be lucrative before earnings, until you hit a really big move, and you have massive losses. I initially lost several thousand before I realized trading earnings through options is a sucker&#39;s game, because the implied value of out of money options will greatly decrease after earnings.</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">5) Making investment decisions based on the day to day news of companies and speculations thereof</span></strong></p><p>Successful investors don&#39;t let the daily company news scare them, but are in it for the long haul. Speculations about production problems of the iPhone 8 isn&#39;t going to make long-term AAPL investors flinch, for instance. While following company news and technical charts can be exciting, if it causes you to touch your investments, it&#39;s probably not a good thing. Time in the stock market is usually more important than trying to time the market. Also, if every time you hear bad news you buy the stock&#39;s put options to safeguard from losing, you&#39;ll lose by default because you&#39;ve paid for so much premium that it erodes your gains. Seemingly every week someone has a theory on why a stock will decline, and they&#39;re usually wrong. Same with the market as a whole. As they say, experts have predicted 23 out of the last 3 market crashes...&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">6) Using mutual funds to invest</span></strong></p><p>This one could easily be most people&#39;s costliest mistake over their lifetime. Like many others, &nbsp;I diligently invested in mutual funds, &nbsp;not fully understanding the management expense ratio of about 1.86% I was paying. In fact the average management expense ratio in Canada is 2.35%. <a href=\"http://www.advisor.ca/news/industry-news/investment-fees-cost-canadians-hundreds-of-thousands-209317\">This could cost you hundreds of thousands over the course of your life</a>, &nbsp;as every year 2.35% of your portfolio is lost to fees. The solution is to use a self directed account and purchase the much more cost-effective ETFs (exchange trades funds). I use <a href=\"http://www.questrade.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Questrade</a>, which doesn&#39;t charge a commission to buy ETFs.

I&#39;ve made the contributions very slowly over the last year. &nbsp;For most of the businesses I have only invested $25(the minimum), though when I made my Initial $1000 deposit, there were few businesses, so I allocated $150-$200 to some of the early ones. There is one business which has been delinquent as of late, meaning the payments are not made on time, but I suspect they will catch up eventually. However, I can&#39;t expect my return to actually 14%, as some loans will inevitability be defaulted on.</p><p>The loans range in various lengths, most between 18 months to 4 years, and get paid back every month in chunks, part interest, part principal. &nbsp;Thus, in order to make the full return expected, one must continually reinvest the proceeds.

However, you will never make the full returns if you don&#39;t reinvest your principal.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike mutual funds and other stock market investments, lending loop does not support RRSP and TFSA at this point, which means that all your gains will be unfortunately taxed at your marginal tax rate. An investment like this would greatly benefit from TFSA, because interest doesn&#39;t count as capital gains, and is thus fully taxes. Lending loop hopes to eventually offer TFSA and RRSP&#39;s however.</p><p>Lending Loop has recently added auto-deposit and auto-invest, allowing you to automatically deposit funds at regular intervals, and automatically invest predetermined amounts (in multiples of $25) in either low risk (6-9%) or high risk (10-25%) . I&#39;ve chosen to automatically invest $25 in all high risk opportunities, and try to match my contribution interval to not have too much money in the account.

Hold in tension how many questions to ask you fellow developers</strong></p><p>You&#39;ll never truly understand something if you always ask your fellow developers after the first signs of trouble. Commit to spending some time understanding something new before you ask for help. If something can be solved with a simple Google search, you should definitely not be asking your fellow developers. You should also attempt to use your debugging tools, like logging and breakpoints to look for the root cause of an issue. While an expert on your team may be able to solve the problem quicker this time, having the result handed to you can stunt your growth and limit your own learning. This doesn&#39;t mean you should never ask for help however. If you can&#39;t make any progress on something for what seems like an unreasonably long time, it can better to ask just to get moving in your current project, but keep in mind that this reduces your own growth as a developer&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2.

Try to bump into the edges your your system, where you interact with the outside world as quickly as possible. If there is an issue, it&#39;s better the other team knows as soon as possible. It&#39;s important identity things in your project that you may rely on a third party for first, so you can give others the most amount of time to respond and address the issue.

Instead of letting something hold you up for a long time because you don&#39;t know how to elegantly solve it, do what you have to to move past the problem for now. Your unconscious mind may help you come up with a solution when you least expect it. Treat your keyboard time preciously, &nbsp;and leverage your mind while away from the computer <span style=\"background-color: initial;\">by bumping into as many difficult issues as you can while at the computer.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Always leave the code base better than how you found it</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t ultimately aim for the quickest solution when committing to a code base, &nbsp;but always try to write code in a way that makes structural sense. You and your fellow developers may be maintaining and adding to a codebase for a long time, so it&#39;s important that the code is easy to follow, &nbsp;the methods are short and appropriately named and thus easy to understand by yourself and others in the future. Less is more in software development, so if you can reduce the amount of code in your codebase by refactoring out common code and put it in modules, superclasses and gems(libraries), you should. However, don&#39;t immediately try remove any and all duplication. If it&#39;s not apparent to you which method of code abstraction you should use, &nbsp;remember that duplication is still better than using the wrong abstraction. Also, don&#39;t reinvent the wheel: if functionality you need can be found in an external library, you&#39;re mostly better of using that than writing extra code yourself.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. Automate and Abstract whenever you can</strong></p><p>This should be applied at many levels. You should set up your system so applications are running without maintenance, and abstract away long, &nbsp;complex command line commands with bash aliases. There is no point memorizing something your machine can memorize for you. If you find yourself performing a lot of tasks that should be repeatable, it can often be better to write a script or a code module that will allow you to perform the same action in the future if it comes up. Once checked into your version control system with some high level documentation, your fellow developers will be able to benefit from your work for a long time. People should not have to look through your code to know how to use it. You should always be looking for ways to simplify and abstract away unnecessary complex and tedious tasks.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Write code that doesn&#39;t need documentation</strong></p><p>Documentation adds another layer that must match the code that you must maintain. &nbsp;It can get out of date, &nbsp;or cause conflicts in your version management system. It&#39;s better to write the code in a way that is self-explanatory. To achieve this, reduce the length of methods you create, and accurately name the methods, &nbsp;describing what they do. If a class does something non-obvious besides its described function, it may be be better to extract that functionality and put it in its own class or module. Finally, ensure you place methods in classes where they make sense. &nbsp;Each file your write should represent a class or object. &nbsp;If methods are like the messages sent to that class or object, ensure that the messages are something you would expect the object to do. If a method makes no sense in the context of a particular object, &nbsp;maybe it should be in a different object.&nbsp;</p>", image_file_name: "apps.jpg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 385364, image_updated_at: "2017-10-22 17:48:43", state: 1, publish_date: "2017-10-31 00:00:00", slug: "my-5-top-tips-to-becoming-a-better-software-developer", job_priority: 1},

  {title: "The no regrets at 80 plan", category_id: 4, user_id: 1, tags: "", body: "<p>Bill Gates said, &nbsp;&#39;most people overestimate the amount they can accomplish in one year, &nbsp;and underestimate the amount they can accomplish in 10 years. &nbsp;Jeff Bezos, &nbsp;found of Amazon, &nbsp;and now the richest man in the world, &nbsp;focuses on not having regrets at 80 when looking back at his life. &nbsp;Clearly, &nbsp;the very successful don&#39;t feel that success is something that comes quickly with little effort. &nbsp;Companies like Amazon and Microsoft are a testament to that. Amazon never turned a profit for many years, and is still being run in a way that worries more about long term growth than quarter to quarter results. Bezos is an expert at crafting a long term vision that sees it dominating dozens of industries, while seamlessly merging them, and using technology to eclipse offline retail. Amazons also dominates the infrastructure cloud space with AWS. While most companies of Amazon&#39;s scale are post-growth, &nbsp;and often focus on returning capital to shareholders, Amazon continues to invest heavily in the business in order to dominate new markets, &nbsp;and make new acquisition. I believe one of the key differences is Jeff Bezos vision of a long term play, &nbsp;one he can look back on in 30 or 40 years and be proud of. Clearly he has been able to convince his investors of this as well, &nbsp;and they are happy to just hold on for the ride, not expecting share buybacks or dividends for a long time.&nbsp;</p><p>Bill Gates on the other hand has moved away from the world for business to full time philanthropy. He and his wife run the largest philanthropic organization in the US which has helped fight polio and AIDS, &nbsp;and has saved millions of lives. &nbsp;Furthermore, &nbsp;he has secured hundreds of billions of donations from other billionaires through the giving pledge, a commitment to donate at least of their net worth to philanthropic causes throughout their lifetime.&nbsp;</p><p>Both of these very successful men have the long view in mind. &nbsp;They don&#39;t just sit on their billions, &nbsp;but are still actively engaged in making their money do useful things. &nbsp;They&#39;re not into get rich quick schemes, &nbsp;but invest in the future. There are many lessons we can learn from them.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, it&#39;s persistence and the ability to see things through that pay off. One cannot build a success story overnight. There are usually years of work behind anything that is a lasting success. Bill Gates has been involved in philanthropy since 1998. Amazon is of a similar age, and didn&#39;t turn a profit for many years. Both have many projects and investments that have yet to be fruitful, and may never be worthwhile. Both take risks and fail a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>They both recognize that the worst thing you can do is never to try. While they have billions to throw behind ideas, and most of us do not, they make great commitments of time to their causes, something many of us do not. Most of us gravitate down the past of least resistance, &nbsp;and spend our free time watching television or aimlessly browsing the Internet.</p><p>To really succeed in life, it helps to really take their advice to heart, and look forward 10, 20 or even 50 years, and work backwards. While we may not be ready today to quit our jobs and start the next great company, or go back to school to pursue a new career path, we have to recognize that it&#39;s OK to have a plan that doesn&#39;t have to be fulfilled right away, and it&#39;s OK to start something that won&#39;t see results for many years.</p><p>Having a long view of your life also helps to give you some perspective regarding your current life<span style=\"background-color: initial;\">. If you&#39;re a student or a new parent, and you don&#39;t have a lot of free time, recognize that these are phases that will pass. If you have goals that you don&#39;t have time for now, you can still prepare for them, and slowly work towards them. For instance, &nbsp;if your goal was to have your own business, &nbsp;but you can&#39;t put in the time required now, &nbsp;there are still many steps you can take to move you towards your goal, even if you&#39;re not going to take the plunge right now. For instance, you can save money towards the goal and invest it if your time frame is fairly long. You can learn the required skills, meet the necessary people and draw up a plan, and work at the next action required to get to your goals. You will always have enough time to to something. The key is to even small windows of time to work towards your goals, rather than simply waiting and hoping you&#39;ll find the motivation and the time later on.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;If we&#39;re always just focused on the next day, month, or even year, we will miss a long term vision for our lives.&nbsp;</p>", image_file_name: "rsz_no_regrets.jpg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 85097, image_updated_at: "2018-01-08 06:04:10", state: 1, publish_date: "2018-01-09 00:00:00", slug: "the-no-regrets-at-80-plan", job_priority: 2},
  {title: "Automating your Financial Success", category_id: 7, user_id: 1, tags: "", body: "<p>Many financial experts urge you to put away 10% of your income, or some such amount. Personally, I try to save a much higher amount because I wish to have the option to retire early. Whatever amount you choose, it should automatically be deduced in some way. While personally I don&#39;t have the temptation to spend money I should be investing, for many people it helps if the amount comes straight out of their bank account automatically, or doesn&#39;t even get there to begin with, allowing easier budgeting. Even if you don&#39;t have a discipline problem, putting the money away at regular intervals allows you to take advantage of cost-dollar averaging more easily, decreasing the risk of going all in on a market high. Further, it&#39;s one less step required. The less payments you have to think about manually each month, the freer you will be to keep track of other important things in your life. It removed willpower from the investment equation, which is a<a href=\"http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/willpower.aspx\">&nbsp;limited resource</a>.</p><p><strong>Investing through your work</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If saving doesn&#39;t come easily to you, &nbsp;the first place to start saving with the least amount of effort is to look for any savings plan your work offers. This would be a 401K in the US or usually a Group RRSP or a TFSA in Canada. These accounts are great because employers often provide some sort of matching (they&#39;ll contribute a percentage of your contributions, up until a certain point). Employers may also cover investment management fees, or at least they&#39;ll often be much lower than mutual funds banks offer, due to the group nature of the fund. Ideally the management expense ratio should be half a percent or less. Further, &nbsp;these are usually set and forget. Typically you can choose a percentage, &nbsp;and you&#39;ll get your matching automatically, &nbsp;and if you get a raise your investment amount will go up proportionally.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, &nbsp;the money never comes into your bank account, &nbsp;but goes straight to the investment fund. The investment fund can be as simple as a target date retirement fund you choose once when you set it up, &nbsp;and is rebalancing and risk adjusted accordingly. It is really the simplest and least painful way to invest.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>DIY Investing</strong></p><p>For those with a bit more financial attitude, investing through a broker, &nbsp;while initially daunting, can still be a nearly automatic affair once set up. You can choose automatic transfers from your bank at regular intervals (for example, &nbsp;on payday). From there on you will typically have to log into your broker account and purchase appropriate stocks or ETFs. &nbsp;Having a broker that doesn&#39;t charge for ETF purchases (for example Questrade) is helpful here, as you may not be depositing much each paycheck, &nbsp;and you don&#39;t want to lose money to transaction fees when purchasing only a few shares.</p><p>The key is to pick some sort of asset allocation (canadiancouchpotato.com is a good place to start or the allocations on <a href=\"https://www.acorns.com/investments/\">https://www.acorns.com/investments/</a>) and stick to it. That means that with all your additional contributions every pay period, you always purchase whatever asset will balance out your original asset allocation. This will help you to typically purchase etfs that have gone down in value, and purchasing less assets that are relatively overvalued in relation to the time period you made your initial contribution. This will allow you to rebalancing your portfolio without having to sell any stocks, until the the portfolio becomes large enough that the contributions themselves aren&#39;t mean full enough to balance the portfolio.&nbsp;</p><p>By that time, &nbsp;having to pay some commission to sell stock won&#39;t seem as painful, &nbsp;as you&#39;ll be selling thousands of dollars worth of etfs to rebalancing.&nbsp;</p><p>Rebalancing your portfolio ensure that your portfolio doesn&#39;t become over exposed to any one asset class or geographic region, and actually increases your return because it forces your to naturally sell high and buy low.</p><p><strong>Staying within your investment account limits</strong></p><p>I typically calculate the amount of contributions I&#39;m allowed to make for the year, and then divide it by the number of contribution intervals. This gets easier then you&#39;re at your maximum, &nbsp;as you don&#39;t have to recalculate every year. &nbsp;While investing outside of tax-sheltered accounts can still be beneficial, it&#39;s nowhere near as effective as accounts that allow you to defer or eliminate taxes, &nbsp;such as RRSP&#39;s or TFSA&#39;s. At the very least I want to make sure I&#39;m using my contributions room. For example, &nbsp;my TFSA contribution room grows by $5500 at the beginning of each year, &nbsp;which means, I contribute $5500/26 = $211 biweekly, split between my work&#39;s TFSA and my Questrade TFSA. Going outside the limits for extended periods of time will cost you, &nbsp;and you&#39;re much better off investing in a non-taxable sheltered account if you have extra money.</p><p>In conclusion, it&#39;s much easier to save and invest if you pay yourself first, meaning you automatically remove the amounts you wish to invest for your bank account on a regular basis. &nbsp;This has the added benefit of allowing you to cost average your investment and reduces the cognitive overhead with having to make investment decisions.</p>", image_file_name: "automating-ecommerce-tasks.png", image_content_type: "image/png", image_file_size: 562395, image_updated_at: "2017-12-26 15:47:01", state: 1, publish_date: "2017-12-26 00:00:00", slug: "automating-your-financial-success", job_priority: 3},
  {title: "Creating vs Consumption and Happiness", category_id: 9, user_id: 1, tags: "", body: "<p>Are producers of content (writing, music, TV, video games, software) happier than those who consume it? Does happiness come from consuming content, or producing it? Some would argue that people who only consume content are watching, listening or reading about others living their lives, &nbsp;whereas producers are actually living it. For instance, hockey players or actors are working and producing &#39;content&#39;, &nbsp;getting paid for what they love to do, &nbsp;whereas many of us just passively observe them, in what is probably the lowest and most braindead of activity.&nbsp;</p><p>I think we need both to be happy. Sometimes you may just want to indulge and watch your favorite series, sport or play a video game. This brings happiness in the moment, &nbsp;and for a time afterwards. It can even be a great shared experience that allows you to bond with others. After a hard day&#39;s work, often all that may be left is the desire just to be a consumer, &nbsp;whether it be food or entertainment. Consuming content is definitely easier than producing content, &nbsp;especially materials of the quality others would want to consume.&nbsp;</p><p>To truly achieve long term happiness, &nbsp;producing content is much more meaningful, especially if many people benefit from it. This second point is sometimes the issue with producing content. &nbsp;You can put things out there, &nbsp;but getting other people to consume it can be difficult. You should not let that discourage you. If you want to be a writer, a speaker, a designer, a developer, athlete or an actor, you should be willing to do all those things regardless of your audience. Passion for these things must long precede success, for without it, &nbsp;you will give up long before any success comes.</p><p>The advent of social media has given many of us an audience for our content. &nbsp;But are we actually contributing anything meaningful or helpful to someone else? Many of us just use social media to build up an image of ourselves, &nbsp;to make us feel better by sharing our most noteworthy moments in life. It even seems like a financially successful strategy for some, sharing images of themselves on instagram. While it may be a good way to gather an audience, I think eventually it would be more fulfilling to be using it as a platform for our art or our writing, to contribute something meaningful to teach, &nbsp;mentor and lift up other people.</p><p>Besides fulfillment, creation of content has many benefits. It fosters critical thought, requiring one to succinctly express thoughts, &nbsp;synthesize knowledge from multiple sources and confidently express researched opinions. It requires knowledge far above the level of consumption. Teaching others your knowledge takes your own understanding of your craft to the next level.&nbsp;</p><p>Most meaningful jobs require the creation of something. Whether it&#39;s a physical product, &nbsp;lesson plans, reports, spreadsheets or code, being an succinct, efficient creator is a valuable skill. While you may view this as obvious, and are more than willing to exchange your time to create something of value at work, the true test is to create something where the monetary reward isn&#39;t immediately obvious, and no one is monitoring you.&nbsp;</p><p>Being able and willing to create something outside of what is required of you at work not only makes one more valued and desired by employers, but also more capable in a self-employed capacity, &nbsp;being more equipped to offer others value directly, &nbsp;without hiding behind an employer. Aside from investing money you already have, and relying on your employer, &nbsp;it is another path to freedom. Having many customers, viewer or clients has its benefits over a single employers, but it is also a more difficult path, at least initially. It can give you flexibility in terms of where and when you work, but can also force you to be always available. Creating for others as an employee, and merely consuming in your spare time, is definitely the path of least resistance. &nbsp;Does it ultimately being happiness, &nbsp;or does that require carving our own path in life? I think we are all different, &nbsp;and we each have to choose what we think is the best path for ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>In future posts, I will focus on how to find your area of contribution, how to stay motivated, how to find time to become a content creator.

However, I still believe it can be measured. And if it can be measured, it can be improved. Just like the stock market, these things don&#39;t go up in a straight line, and you may have setbacks, and your knowledge may plateau, but over the course of many months and years, &nbsp;things should generally improve.

That&#39;s enough to run the distance of 40 marathons, even if you start off at a really slow pace. &nbsp;It&#39;s enough time to read 20 books, or start and maintain a blog, &nbsp;or write a short book, or learn and improve a number of skills.</p><p>The key is to use the power of habit, and public accountability to become better at something that&#39;s hard for you normally. Often, &nbsp;just like investment, &nbsp;it&#39;s best to pay yourself first. You may spend a 8-10 hours a day at work, after which you may find it difficult to focus on what you should be doing to improve yourself in other ways. Perhaps if you find it hard to exercise, you should get up each morning and spend the first number of minutes walking, running or doing aerobic exercise. It does not have to be long, it doesn&#39;t have to be intense, but given enough time, you will become better at it. Consistency is key here, and his better than intensity.&nbsp;</p><p>So how can you force yourself to be consistent?&nbsp;</p><p>1) Set aside time that&#39;s guaranteed to be yours. This may be in the morning before work, late at night before bed, at lunch, or just after work, &nbsp;whatever time you can guarantee you won&#39;t be interrupted in.</p><p>2) find a time to make up if you do get interrupted, either internally or externally&nbsp;</p><p>3) create a visual reminder, &nbsp;preferably where you and others can see it. &nbsp;Putting an X through each day in a calendar is a good any to do it. This works even if you don&#39;t do it every day. Even if your goal it to be done 3 times a week, &nbsp;you should try to pick your days, and have backup days you can fall back on.&nbsp;</p><p>4) Calculate and anticipate the potential benefits 1, 5, 10, 20, 30 years down the road, but don&#39;t dwell on the long term goal, but find a way to do each day to get closer to the prize. <span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Focus on the process, not the goal. Even if you just spend time each day without seemingly discrete progress, you will move towards your goals</span></p><p>5) measure your progress, but not too frequently. If the goal is to lose weight, &nbsp;don&#39;t jump on the scale every day, &nbsp;but every two weeks at most. Your weight fluctuates daily, and you won&#39;t be able to measure daily progress. If you want to measure your ability at a particular skill or success in a business, the measuring interval may be a month, or quarterly. All you need is a set of metrics you can compare from interval to interval. While it seems like this is a long time to see progress, in retrospect you will be amazed at all you have accomplished by your consistency.</p>", image_file_name: "thepowerofcompounding.png", image_content_type: "image/png", image_file_size: 163734, image_updated_at: "2017-11-21 03:30:11", state: 1, publish_date: "2017-11-21 00:00:00", slug: "the-compounding-principle-and-the-power-of-habit", job_priority: 2},

There are perhaps 20 billion like our sun, with perhaps 1/5th of them with earth-like planets in their habitable zone - where life could exist. If 0.1% of these had life, there would be 1 million planets with life. &nbsp;This leads to an important question</p><p>Where are all the aliens?</p><p>It gets even worse when you recognize that the sun is much younger than many of the other stars in the galaxy, billions of years, in fact. Life on other planets around other stars in the milky way could have conceivably existed for more than 7 billion years before the earth was even formed. Even if one of these had become a space travelling super civilization we would have noticed by now. &nbsp;This is because an advanced alien species should be able to to colonize the galaxy in matter of 2 million years or less, &nbsp;assuming a slow, &nbsp;but exponential expansion.</p><p>This question regarding the apparent contradiction of the age abd vastness of space versus its apparent emptiness is called the Fermi paradox</p><p><br></p><p>The Great Filter</p><p>Some have speculated that there must be some point along their evolution that species were prevented from progressing.

Perhaps they have a prime directive, like in star trek. Or they don&#39;t interact, just like we don&#39;t interact with insects. Or they just hide, but then wipe anyone out once they reach a sufficiently advanced level of technology. &nbsp;Maybe colonizing the galaxy just isn&#39;t the goal when you get to that level of technology</p><p>Or maybe there is this chance, however remote, that we&#39;re the most advanced species currently in the galaxy, a blue dot all alone in the vast emptiness of space. &nbsp;Perhaps we will never know in our lifetime.

At the very basic level it is a <a href=\"16\">pomodoro</a> tracking tool. It even sounds like a tomato timer. But it&#39;s so much more than that. It allows you to plan tasks in multiple categories and split them into Pomodoro. It allows you to assign an estimated number of pomodoro to a task which you can change at any time. Unlike other pomodoro tools i&#39;ve tried, it doesn&#39;t try to limit your pomodoros per task to 6 or 7 before splitting it up, and this gives a lot more flexibility if you wish to group certain kinds of tasks into one.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">Another thing I love about it is the reports feature. It allows one to review the number of pomodoros done in the past, and shows a very pretty graph. There is limit to far back you can go, and it is thus easy to assess and track your progress.&nbsp;It encourages me to try for more pomodoro to break previous weekly or daily records.&nbsp;A key feature of the pomodoro is that distracting thoughts or tasks are to be written down for later, and teamviz allows for that as well.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">TeamViz is not without some faults however. The most glaring is that the android version is completely unreliable. Typically it will crash before the timer is up, and thus i&#39;ve given up its use altogether. The desktop version are generally stable, but they do have the occasional graphical glitch. For instance, the program can&#39;t display pomodoro past 99 on the main interface window, and the rows of pomodoro on the timer window tends to run off the screen.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">Nevertheless, it is the best combined pomodoro/overall project tracker that i know of. Typically it takes two programs to accomplish what TeamViz does, and I find that too cumbersome to be practical.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">At this point all the features seem to be free, although the <a href=\"http://www.teamviz.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">company website</a> states that the synchronization is actually $1.99 a month. If this ever got enforced, I would have to upgrade, as its a must have feature, as TeamViz runs on all of my computers, on both windows and ubuntu, and without the synchronzie feature it would lose a lot of its appeal.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><br></p>", image_file_name: "TeamViz.png", image_content_type: "image/png", image_file_size: 256144, image_updated_at: "2015-03-13 03:30:04", state: 1, publish_date: nil, slug: "teamviz", job_priority: 3},

Decent exposure gives you an easy way to expose an object in every action of your controller and figures out the appropriate action, based on whether the object instance can be found.

This involved writing a resource method for each model inside a seperate strategy file. I was happy to see this was removed in version 3, as I thought it would be acceptable to just write this code in a controller, and putting in a separate strategy file seemed confusing.</p><p>If you want to still use them in version 3, the new syntax is something like&nbsp;</p><pre> exposure_config :current_user_strategy, find: -&gt;(id, scope){\r\n    post = scope.find(id)\r\n\r\n    if current_user != post.user\r\n      raise ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    post\r\n  }</pre><p><br></p><p>However, I find it easier to just stay clear on the syntax entirely and just use a fetch:</p><pre>expose(:posts){ scoped_posts }</pre><p>Where scoped_posts&#39; is a method that returns the object(s) that you want.

  {title: "Rails page caching for improved performance", category_id: 8, user_id: 1, tags: "", body: "<p>In order to reduce the load on your server and allow more concurrent users to hit your website, you may use caching. There are many types of caching in Ruby on Rails, some of which are discussed in the <a href=\"http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html\">guides</a>. Some require the use of a dedicated caching service such as AWS&#39;s Elasticache (memcache or redis). The minimum cost of one of those instances is the same as a t2 micro. If you are only running a simple Rails app, this service may not be worth it, especially since there is a simple method of caching that doesn&#39;t cost anything extra and provides an immense speed boost in many situations. This is described in the Rails guides as page caching, and while it was removed the Rails core since Rails 4, there is still a handy gem that provide the same functionality called <a href=\"https://github.com/rails/actionpack-page_caching\">actionpack-page_caching</a>.

  {title: "Staying healthy at work by standing and walking more", category_id: 9, user_id: 1, tags: "Health, fitbit, walking, standing desk", body: "<p>Today&#39;s modern workplaces are hazardous to your health, but not in the same ways as in the past. If your work in a modern office, you probably aren&#39;t exposed to dangerous materials, and you&#39;re not likely to break your back lifting anything heavy, freeze extremities exposed to the elements, or get crushed or pinched between dangerous machinery. The biggest danger of the modern office is the amount of time spent sitting, the lack of any kind of movement, and the overabundant access to unhealthy treats. These factors seem innocuous compared to workplace dangers of the past, but ignored they can cause all kinds of health risks, and lead to an early death. <a href=\"http://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2653704/patterns-sedentary-behavior-mortality-u-s-middle-aged-older-adults\">Here</a>is a study that shows long sedentary periods increase the chance of death in middle aged to older adults. So how can you prevent the modern office hazards?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1) Move more</strong></p><p>Ensure you&#39;re at least getting up every hour or so and stretch, get a coffee, more about the room. If you need someone to remind you to do this, get a <a href=\"https://www.fitbit.com/en-ca/home\">Fitbit</a>, which warns you if you&#39;re not taking at least 250 steps per hour. I have one, an as annoying as it can be to break focus, its better (and often more productive, among other <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/changepower/201704/how-do-work-breaks-help-your-brain-5-surprising-answers\">benefits</a>) to have a break once in a while. It can make taking more steps throughout the day fun, and it tries to gamify taking more steps. The &#39;gold&#39; standard of taking 10000 steps isn&#39;t all that hard, and I find I can often nearly hit that by taking small walks throughout the day. If I take an hour walk in the evening, I can often hit 15000 total, which should apparently be our new <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/well/move/should-15000-steps-a-day-be-our-new-exercise-target.html\">target</a>. I don&#39;t find it really as hard to hit if you don&#39;t try to do it all at once.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2) Take the stairs</strong></p><p>Unless you&#39;re disabled there should be no reason to take the elevator. I suppose this depends where you work, but I have to go down and up two flights of stairs to get a coffee, which helps to give me some small amounts of exercise throughout the day. The Fitbit tracks this as well, and will give you badges for climbing a lot of stairs, and allows comparison between days so you can try to break your records</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3) Use a standing desk for at least part of the day. </strong></p><p>Standing at least part of the day can be really healthy. It burns approximately 50 calories an hour and reduces the amount of time spent sitting, which is always desirable. It reduces obesity risk, cancer risk, and <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/thomas-b-trafecanty/the-benefits-and-consider_b_9996782.html\">extends your lifespan</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4) Drink lots of fluids</strong></p><p>Drinking water, or even coffee or tea and keeps you hydrated and reduces food cravings. It not only helps you lose weight, but it makes you more energetic (to a point, watch the caffeine), boosts your immune system and prevents headaches.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5) Control your eating</strong></p><p>&nbsp;if snacking is a problem, bring your own healthy snacks you can munch on guilt free, such as fruits and vegetables, or calories foods such as rice cakes. It&#39;s better to have a plan of what you&#39;ll eat if you&#39;re hungry rather than eating too many sugary treats on a whim. This seems to be a legitimate problem in today&#39;s offices. According to the results of a survey, women engaging in office work consume more than <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4945180/Women-consume-100-000-extra-calories-chocolate-work.html\">100,000 extra calories</a> a year in office snacks. This works out to more than 400 calories a day. In a vacuum, consuming 100,000 extra calories would result in a weight gain of 26 pounds. However, I suspect that since these women are probably not gaining an extra 26 pounds a year, they probably don&#39;t consume enough nutritious food for breakfast or lunch, and this is making up for a shortfall in calorie consumption.</p><p><br></p><p>The modern office environment is anything but ideal for the health of modern man. A healthy human should spend several hours a day on their feet moving, but modern life involves far too much sitting, both and home and at work. Furthermore, this is often complimented with the consumption of very unhealthy snacks. To counteract these one must be mindful of their negative effects and work towards a healthier lifestyle. That said, for those who exercise regularly, research <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/how-much-you-need-to-exercise-to-make-up-for-sitting-al-1784399171\">now seems to show</a> that an hour of exercise can counteract a whole day of sitting, so if you have the time do it daily, exercise by itself may be enough to counteract the sitting, assuming you can keep calorie consumption in check.</p>", image_file_name: "Sit-Stand-Adjustable-Desk-FlexTable.jpg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 185746, image_updated_at: "2018-03-20 02:59:33", state: 1, publish_date: "2018-03-20 00:00:00", slug: "staying-healthy-at-work-by-standing-and-walking-more", job_priority: 3},

For instance, transaction speed is faster, transaction costs are lower, and it&#39;s not as inflationary as Bitcoin (supply is not as limited). It is however a proprietary coin. Ripple is also the name of the company that manages it.&nbsp;</p><p>A couple weeks ago, I set out to buy a small amount of XPR, but purchasing it is not so easy.&nbsp;</p><p>Coinbase and QuadrigaCX doesn&#39;t sell it. &nbsp;I tired signing up for Biostar, Kraken, and Gatehub, but got stuck on some part of the verification process. The only site when I was able to purchase ripple was Binance. To do so I&#39;ve been buying Etherium on Coinbase, and then sending it to my Binance account, and then converting it to Ripple.&nbsp;</p><p>I&#39;ve only purchased a small amount so far, but I wish I purchase more, &nbsp;as my investment has already doubled. Once I aquire a good amount of ripple, the next step will be to move it from Binance to my own ripple wallet. I haven&#39;t settled on which wallet to move it to, &nbsp;but I may also branch out and use my ripple investment buy other currencies on Binance. I&#39;ve noticed that some ICO&#39;s are starting to allow purchases using Ripple, so I may try that.</p><p>Edit: the description above is now several weeks old, an eternity in cryptoland. In that time, Ripple has trippled, gone down to below a dollar, and then recovered somewhat, sitting at $1.14, just above where I bought it at $1.00. At these levels I feel it&#39;s a fairly good investment, and it looks like western union is now trialing out ripple, and many more partnerships are coming.</p><p>I had taken some of the profit at $2+ off the table and bought into the Swiss borg ico (initial coin offering). The CHSB token is now unfortunately trading below ico price.

Regardless of how much discipline you have, it appears that having to use it at least temporarily reduces your available willpower. Having to make more decisions earlier in the day apparently depletes your ability to make quality decisions later in the day. This appears to be the reason some influential people, &nbsp;such Steve Jobs or Barack Obama would always wear nearly the same outfits. Judges also appear to be making less favorable decisions the longer it has been since they&#39;ve had a break.&nbsp;</p><p>Knowing this, &nbsp;there are some decisions we can make ahead of time that reduce our susceptibility to decision fatigue, &nbsp;or willpower depletion. Taking breaks, and reducing the amount of decisions one has to make earlier in the day also help.&nbsp;</p><p>Our whole day we have to fight distractions that try to prevent us from getting what we need done. Whether it&#39;s email, the desire to do your online banking or shopping during work hours, &nbsp;a flood of notifications coming from your phone or computer, or your co-workers asking for your help. The easiest and most surefire way of resisting these is to eliminate as many of them automatically before they even get to you. Turn off the email client on your computer or phone, &nbsp;and set aside one or more specific times of day when you manually check them. Ensure your browser isn&#39;t sending you notifications from your favorite sites throughout the day. Turn off notifications on your phone, &nbsp;except for the bare minimum required for your work or home life.</p><p>Further, block sites that you should avoid on your browser, &nbsp;and make other browser as inaccessible as possible. Or purchase an app such as focus (https://heyfocus.com) to block it on all browsers.</p><p>Whenever you are tempted to open a non-work related site, stop yourself and count down from 5, and pretend your boss is standing right behind you. If it helps to pretend you have to ship your browser history to someone at the end of the day, do that as well. Even if your work requires you to wait for something, such as the completion of a test suite, you&#39;re better off staring at the screen, or getting up to get a coffee, than breaking your work flow and randomly browsing the web. It may be easier to go cold turkey this way than starting to read something on a site that you may wish to complete later.</p><p>The reward for this is a much more productive day and more time concentrating on the problem at hand. It allows you to push past your discomfort and solve problems you may otherwise be tempted to ignore or only superficially address.

Even if your employer doesn&#39;t recognize your increased productivity, over time you will become much more skilled and in demand by other employees, and more capable of selling your services to the highest bidder.

If you ever take public transit, and are not on your own phone, you can&#39;t help but notice how prevalent this trend is. But sometimes I&#39;m forced to ask myself if life passing me by, because I&#39;m skipping my boredom with my smartphone. Eventually, I have trouble enjoying the quiet moments, but require constant simulation.</p><p>&nbsp;In the future I expect this trend to become more prevalent even, as cell phones are replaced by wearables, &nbsp;or even augmentation implants. Is the time when one can merely spend time with his own thoughts coming to an end? Are we many of us incapable of enjoying time in quiet contemplation, or focusing on the tasks we&#39;re doing at this present moment? Are boring tasks and moments ones to eradicate? Should we seek to optimize and outsource them so we can move on to more interesting thing, where we can finally enjoy ourselves after our hard labor? Our should we seek contentment and happiness in whatever we&#39;re currently doing, &nbsp;realizing happiness is a choice, &nbsp;not the result of external forces? This is not an easy question. &nbsp;After all, it seems only logical to do more of what brings you happiness, and to reduce boredom and suffering.</p><p>It seems best do learn to enjoy the unavoidably boring parts of life, not to try to avoid them by getting out your smart phone, &nbsp;especially when it only extends the time required to complete a task. These times spend on your smartphone, &nbsp;unless managed carefully, &nbsp;are seldom productive, and only ensure to rob you of your precious time. So before you whip out the smart phone and browse, its best to evaluate if your current task in the real world will take a nosedive in effectiveness. While it may make sense to use your smartphone while waiting in line somewhere, using it to distract yourself while doing dishes or trying to get ready in the morning will only extend the routine, robbing you of precious time.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, it also may make sense to reduce the boring parts of life you don&#39;t enjoy by automating them away. &nbsp;As much as some may say that doing dishes by hand builds character, &nbsp;if you can significantly reduce the amount of time you spend doing them, &nbsp;and you don&#39;t find the activity enjoyable, it probably makes sense to put in a dishwasher. Also, it can make sense to perhaps outsource takes you do not enjoy. &nbsp;Often this only makes sense however if doing so can allow you to increase your productivity elsewhere. For most people, outsourcing yard work is not going to result in spending more hours working, &nbsp;but more sedentary hours in front of a screen. In that case, doing your own chores is a win win, &nbsp;both increasing the amount of exercise you do and reducing the money coming out of your pocket. It always makes sense to learn to love an activity that is both good for your health and good for your pocketbook. While you can outsource many things, you have to take care of your own health. You can get others to encourage you in it, but no one can be healthy for you.&nbsp;</p><p>But how do you enjoy the mundane? This is an especially difficult questions for new parents, as the pace of life can slow right down, and you don&#39;t enjoy a lot of the freedoms you&#39;re used to previously. Instead, even previously simple tasks can become chores, as you&#39;re life seems to revolve around your baby. First, acceptance is critical. Just accept that regardless of where you&#39;d rather be right now, or what you&#39;d rather be doing, you can&#39;t really escape your task at hand, &nbsp;and you might as well try to enjoy the present moment. Don&#39;t try to focus on how you may feel like your wasting your time, but accept that whatever youre doing is the the most important task right now. Try to live in the moment of the task, focus on what you&#39;re currently doing and the sensations involved. Resist the urge to let your mind wander, but be mindful of your thoughts, and redirect them back to this present moment.&nbsp;</p><p>The key is not to let the past or the future dominate the present moment. By focusing on what you&#39;re looking forward to, or an event in the past, you&#39;re ruining you&#39;re enjoyment of the the present. So whenever you find yourself doing that, take a deep breath, count to five, and try to just enjoy life right now.&nbsp;</p>", image_file_name: "Dirty_dishes.jpeg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 41929, image_updated_at: "2018-01-01 23:19:43", state: 1, publish_date: "2018-01-02 00:00:00", slug: "enjoying-the-mundane-moments-in-life", job_priority: 2},

There is no question that it requires some sacrifices and tradeoffs, &nbsp;but I believe that these are worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some of the ingredients for early financial independence. While you don&#39;t need to do all of these, the more of them you do successfully, the faster you will be financially independent.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1) spend less than you earn, much less</strong></p><p>The more you save and invest, the earlier you will reach financial independence. This is because you not only save more when you spend less, you require less resources to be financially independent. If you&#39;re used to living on less, and thus your costs are lower, you will also need less in retirement. A good post to explain this can be found <a href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/\">here</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>2) Invest in yourself through education</strong></p><p>It is extremely difficult to retire early if your income is really low. There are some minimum expenses that are difficult to avoid, without which living requires too much sacrifice. For instance, you&#39;ll need somewhere to live, &nbsp;regardless if you decide to rent or buy. Unless you&#39;re business savvy, &nbsp;it&#39;s going to be hard to make sufficient income without some form of education. Learning a trade works too. Education isn&#39;t necessarily something you do at school, but is a lifelong process.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3) Get your partner on board </strong></p><p>Regardless if how much you earn, it&#39;s not going result in financial independence if your partner is not on board. This has more to do with philosophy than earnings. If your partner doesn&#39;t believe in saving for the future as much as you do, they will expect earnings to be spent on the conveniences of today, and it will be difficult to put away enough money to retire early.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4) invest early, &nbsp;invest often, don&#39;t pay too many fees</strong></p><p>The safest way to invests is to frequently purchase broad market index funds through ETFs which have low fees. You get the benefit of diversification and cost averaging, &nbsp;and you avoid paying someone a large chunk of money to invest. You don&#39;t try to predict the market, but frequently add to your positions regardless if the market goes up or down</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p><p>These will help, but are definitely not mandatory.&nbsp;</p><p>I) owning your own home</p><p>Over the long term, &nbsp;this is a significant hedge against inflation at least. While it may not seem like a slam dunk before its paid off, rent keep going up over the long haul, &nbsp;and never goes away. While it can be somewhat cheaper initially, eventually the cost of renting will go up, &nbsp;whereas the amount you owe on a mortgage goes down, and the payment is less of a burden due to inflation (wages rise, but cost of rent will rise with it)&nbsp;</p><p>II) owning a rental property or two</p><p>Assuming you get a good deal on it and it&#39;s at least somewhat cash flow positive, the return on your initial down-payment can be much higher than you may get in the stock market due to the leverage of borrowed money. &nbsp;This is not without some work though. While investing in the stock market can be done completely passively, real estate is not without some required work. Also, it&#39;s unlikely you will make money on it if you outsource the property management. At the very least, &nbsp;you will give up a large chunk of your profits</p><p>III) have a side hustle</p><p>Whether it&#39;s an online business, a traditional business or you freelance or consult, or you have a blog or drive a taxi, a side gig can give you some additional income to accelerate your investment gains.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>", image_file_name: "baking-ingredients-on-table.jpg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 63117, image_updated_at: "2017-12-19 23:04:20", state: 1, publish_date: "2017-12-19 00:00:00", slug: "ingredients-to-early-financial-independence", job_priority: 3},

Some of my favourite financial blogs, such as <a href=\"//mymoneymustache.com\">mymoneymustache.com</a> or <a href=\"//financialsamurai.com\">financialsamurai.com</a> net their owners hundreds of thousands a year. Both sites are well established, and the owners still make a lot of income even when they don&#39;t put a lot of work into the site.

That said, like any business, it requires discipline, and success is not guaranteed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5) To leave a legacy</strong></p><p>Like any business, a blog is something you may wish to pass onto your children. Depending on its success, it may be carried forward by your family, leaving something yourself behind upon your death.

There are many roadblocks and excuses people can use to prevent themselves from making progress, or to stick with it if they don&#39;t seem to be making headway right away. Perhaps you don&#39;t have a lot of free time, or feel like you have little to contribute. Here are some of the tips I&#39;ve found that help me to gain some traction.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>1) Just start </strong></p><p>Finding a topic can me the most difficult, but each of us is unique in some ways. We each have our own interests and perspectives on things, and have some sort of knowledge others may benefits from. If often helps just to write your preliminary thought down, even if you cant think of a title, are not sure how you will organize it or how everything will go together. It&#39;s important to remember that you&#39;re not publishing the first things you&#39;re writing down: You can change what you write repeatedly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2) Give yourself lots of writing opportunities</strong></p><p>Even if you don&#39;t have much free time on your hands, you probably have some. Personally, I find i&#39;m more likely to make progress on a blog post if I have the opportunity to write any time of day by using my smart phone to write. I often have little chunks of time where I could be writing, but tend to gravitate towards browsing the internet. Some of you may find it helpful to write notes on paper as ideas come to you. If you wait until you get to sit in front of a computer to write, you may forget ideas you have, and unless you manage to find consistent time to do so, your writing opportunities may be sparse</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3) if you struggle to release content, force yourself to stick to a specific release schedule</strong></p><p>Consistency is more important that perfection. You can&#39;t be afraid to share your thoughts with the world. If your platform supports it, &nbsp;set a release date on a predefined interval for all blogs that you&#39;re working on (I&#39;m doing weekly) . Doing this actually forced me to finish a post, &nbsp;instead of just starting a number of posts without ever finishing them. While you may not have a large audience early on, &nbsp;and posts are not necessarily permanent once they&#39;re released, this nevertheless forces you to make a post release-worthy. For other types of creative &nbsp;pursuits, this may be more difficult, &nbsp;unless you can create some sort of public accountability for you getting your work done. If your projects come in smaller, discrete chunks, &nbsp;such as YouTube videos, similar ideas can work, &nbsp;but if you&#39;re writing a book, &nbsp;it may be difficult for others to keep you accountable for your progress. Therefore, unless you are very motivated, it will be easier to blog or vlog than to write a book.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4) Find reasons to stick to it that give you motivation</strong></p><p>There are many motivations you may have for writing a blog, &nbsp;or a vlog, &nbsp;or producing some sort of content or creating software. &nbsp;If you write these down, &nbsp;you may be more willing to keep going when you don&#39;t see result away.

Saving as if you were going to retire (becoming financially independent) gives you options. Once you spend the money, your options will always be diminished. Unless you&#39;re confident of your life&#39;s paths and you&#39;re spending towards it, saving and investing your money defers having to make a decision for your future now</p><p><strong>2) Your future earnings may not be entirely in your control</strong></p><p>Steady, &nbsp;reliable, &nbsp;long-term employment seems to be becoming harder to come by today. &nbsp;Work seems to be becoming increasingly automated, &nbsp;and people, &nbsp;if needed at all, &nbsp;become part-time cogs in the machine. Even if you have reliable employment with a pension, what Is to say that you want to tie yourself to that company, &nbsp;or that it will be around long enough to pay your pension? You may desire to adjust your lifestyle to be more flexible, by becoming a freelancer or running a business, &nbsp;but your income may thus not be as reliable. &nbsp;Thus, &nbsp;if your require most of your income to live your lifestyle and save little, &nbsp;you will be stuck to your job.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3) Compounded growth in the early years can set up you for life</strong></p><p>Most people save for retirement backwards. They contribute little early in their careers, and more as they get older. But from pure numbers perspective it doesn&#39;t make sense. Contributions made earlier have much more time to compound, &nbsp;requiring only minimum contributions later on if you desire to go the traditional retirement route. If you even lived saving 50% percent of your income for the first 5 years, and didn&#39;t touch it or add to it until a normal retirement age, you could easily have an additional million to retire on.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4) it gives your life focus and discipline</strong></p><p>Spending less forces you to make decisions about your priorities.

That alone puts us in a privileged fraction of the world&#39;s population. Most of us don&#39;t struggle due to lack of food, lack of medicine or lack of shelter, allowing us to focus on higher needs such as self-actualization. &nbsp;While we don&#39;t have everything, &nbsp;and we do have really issues, &nbsp;which may be financial, emotional, &nbsp;or psychological, most of us live in a place of relative political stability, physical safety and many modern comforts.&nbsp;</p><p>By merely existing and experiencing our lives we should feel lucky. Intelligent life doesn&#39;t exist everwhere we look, and a lot of variables need to overlap for it to happen. While may exist in may places in the universe, we&#39;ve still not discovered it outside of our own species. Even that any of us exist at all, given the chain of copulations required to bring us here, seems to be a lucky accident we should appreciate daily.&nbsp;</p><p>We are also in a time in history when most sicknesses can be cured or have been cured, &nbsp;where infant mortality is at record lows, and where we no longer die due to now trivialized diseases. We have more opportunities, &nbsp;more technology, &nbsp;more automation, and an easier life than at any other time in human history. There is less violence, less discrimination on the basis of genders, sexual orientation, or by most other metrics.&nbsp;</p><p>Technology has made the world a smaller place, with instantaneous communication across the globe, and transportation that can get us places faster than ever before, allowing us to live and work further away. Every part of the world is potentially accessible to us, in that if we wanted to we could easily go there to visit and return within the week.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet despite all of this, people in the West seem more unhappy than ever before. We compare ourselves to others and become jealous. The lives of the wealthy are on display, &nbsp;and no matter how successful you are, there is always someone wealthier, more attractive, or happier than you are. We know more about the lives of others than we ever have, due to Facebook and other social media where other like to display the happiest moments in their lives.&nbsp;</p><p>We need to view our lives in the context of history and the rest of the world to really appreciate how good we have it. Intelligent life seems to be rare in the history of the galaxy and even in the history of this planet. How can we not feel anything but gratitude to be alive in this small moment in history, to be intelligent beings capable of reason and thought, to live in a society where there is freedom of speech, democracy, opportunities to learn, grow and be recognized and valued?&nbsp;</p><p>I&#39;m not saying we should stop striving to improve society. You may still live in a society with injustice, unfairness and poverty. Discontent is after all a powerful catalyst for improvement. Nevertheless, perspective of how far we have come as a species, and of how rare and precious life is should be enough for you to experience great gratitude. Beyond that, you must have many things to be grateful for such as friends, family, health, or gainful employment.</p><p>Gratitude for this present moment, regardless of where you are at is critical for your happiness, mental well-being, and long-term motivation.&nbsp;</p>", image_file_name: "gratitiude2.jpg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 62478, image_updated_at: "2018-01-15 06:04:31", state: 1, publish_date: "2018-01-23 00:00:00", slug: "enjoying-the-mundane-moments-in-life-338ab9a1-d225-40c3-90ed-47ca420a8b4d", job_priority: 2},

For those who don&#39;t know, a pomodoro is a bounded unit of time, during which one is to do their best not to get distracted. It is a unit of work during which checking your e-mail is a no-no. Pomodoro is the italian word for tomato, because the technique was orignially applied using a tomato timer. Typically the pomodoro interval is 25 minutes, with a 5 minute break, and a 15 minute break after 4 pomodoro.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">The idea is that bounding your time helps increase productivity. This is based on parkinson&#39;s law, which states that t<span>he demand on a resource tends to expand to match the supply of that resource. When applied to time, it means that any project, regardless of how complex, will expand to fill in the allotted time. Time will get taken up due to unnecessary revising and reediting, or most likely because of procastination. A project with a long deadline doesn&#39;t appear very urgent, and thus we&#39;re unlikely to tackle it until that deadline is looming.</span></p><p class=\"fr-tag\">For me, it often helps to get over a hump. When I dread a task, using the promodoro technique can encourage me to get started, as I know that after 25 minutes I can have a break. Often by then I&#39;m totally into my work, and don&#39;t need it. I find it&#39;s helpful to have a way to not only track the 25 minute intervals, but to add them up and record them.
