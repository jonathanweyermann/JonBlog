A personal wiki can function like a mind map, and since links can go to anywhere, information doesn't have to be strictly hierarchical.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">I realized that one of the simple tools I already use,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.colornote.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Color Note</a>,&nbsp;is capable of creating links to other pages. To do it, you simply add [[ &nbsp;]] brackets around a string of text, and it instantly links to another page. If the page doesn't exist, Color Note will all you to create it once the link is clicked. This has encouraged me to reorganize colorNote.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">I've noticed that a windows 8 Metro version of Color Note has been released, which has helped made color note more useful for me, but I still wish there was a general web service for it.

I found it helpful to make notes so I could go back and try to apply some of the techniques to my life. Andy explains SQ3R, a method of reading where you prepare yourself before you read in full. He explains how damaging context switching is, and explains ways we can minimize is. He is a big fan of mind-maps, and suggests the use of a personal wiki as an external storage space for your mind, something i'm attempting to do with <a href=\"13\">Color Note</a> at the moment. Even something like keeping a learning portfolio and treating it like a financial portfolio, where you invest time instead of money was interesting to me. While it seems like a no-brainer, the comparision made makes seem more important and urgent.

Given the success of some of the more popular mobile games, it seems like an enticing idea.&nbsp;Having received a 15 day trail period of Buildbox, I spent a fairly significant chunk of time creating a game (according to my favorite time tracking app&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.teamviz.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">TeamViz</a>, i've dedicated 40 <a href=\"http://pomodorotechnique.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pomodoro</a>&nbsp;to it).

While I feel that my game felt like a fairly good game compared to a lot of what was out there, I came to realize that the axium of \"Build it and they will come\" is probably not true, and to be successful, I'd have to not only make good games, but learn to promote them well.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">As for buildbox itself, it delivers on what it promises, though the game feels like it has a bit of a blackbox feel, as the code seems inaccessible inside Android Studio. Thus there is always the feeling that something that could give the game a bit of an edge, such as leaderboards is not completely implementable.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">While buildbox has allowed its creators to put out some great games rather fast, their success with the games has a lot more to do with how they market them. The average joe creating his first game isn't to have nearly the same magintude of success. Still is a good experience though, but not one worth upwards of $2600.</p>", image_file_name: "buildboxlap.png", image_content_type: "image/png", image_file_size: 220227, image_updated_at: "2015-03-13 02:05:05", state: 1, publish_date: nil},
  {title: "The importance of bounded time", category_id: 4, user_id: 1, tags: "pomodoro, time management", body: "<p class=\"fr-tag\">Even since I've started using the <a href=\"http://pomodorotechnique.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pomodoro</a> technique, I feel like my productivity has increased greatly. For those who don't know, a pomodoro is a bounded unit of time, during which one is to do their best not to get distracted. It is a unit of work during which checking your e-mail is a no-no. Pomodoro is the italian word for tomato, because the technique was orignially applied using a tomato timer. Typically the pomodoro interval is 25 minutes, with a 5 minute break, and a 15 minute break after 4 pomodoro.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">The idea is that bounding your time helps increase productivity. This is based on parkinson's law, which states that t<span>he demand on a resource tends to expand to match the supply of that resource. When applied to time, it means that any project, regardless of how complex, will expand to fill in the allotted time. Time will get taken up due to unnecessary revising and reediting, or most likely because of procastination. A project with a long deadline doesn't appear very urgent, and thus we're unlikely to tackle it until that deadline is looming.</span></p><p class=\"fr-tag\">For me, it often helps to get over a hump. When I dread a task, using the promodoro technique can encourage me to get started, as I know that after 25 minutes I can have a break. Often by then I'm totally into my work, and don't need it. I find it's helpful to have a way to not only track the 25 minute intervals, but to add them up and record them.

  {title: "Lending Loop Experiment ", category_id: 7, user_id: 1, tags: "", body: "<p>While there have been many online peer to peer lending opportunities open to US citizens, such as Prosper and Lending Club, lending options in Canada have been non-existent in Canada until October 2016, when Lending Loop received regulatory approval to offer its platform in Canada. Lending Loop is now making loans to dozens of Canadian businesses, and has over 10,000 investors.</p><p>I&#39;d like to share my current result with the platform, &nbsp;and my impressions thus far.&nbsp;</p><p>As you can see from the screen shot above, I&#39;m currently up $129 with a total investment of around $2900. I&#39;ve made the contributions very slowly over the last year. &nbsp;For most of the businesses I have only invested $25(the minimum), though when I made my Initial $1000 deposit, there were few businesses, so I allocated $150-$200 to some of the early ones. There is one business which has been delinquent as of late, meaning the payments are not made on time, but I suspect they will catch up eventually. However, I can&#39;t expect my return to actually 14%, as some loans will inevitability be defaulted on.</p><p>The loans range in various lengths, most between 18 months to 4 years, and get paid back every month in chunks, part interest, part principal. &nbsp;Thus, in order to make the full return expected, one must continually reinvest the proceeds. This doesn&#39;t bother me though, as the returned capital allows more diversification and reduces risk. However, you will never make the full returns if you don&#39;t reinvest your principal.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike mutual funds and other stock market investments, lending loop does not support RRSP and TFSA at this point, which means that all your gains will be unfortunately taxed at your marginal tax rate. An investment like this would greatly benefit from TFSA, because interest doesn&#39;t count as capital gains, and is thus fully taxes. Lending loop hopes to eventually offer TFSA and RRSP&#39;s however.</p><p>Lending Loop has recently added auto-deposit and auto-invest, allowing you to automatically deposit funds at regular intervals, and automatically invest predetermined amounts (in multiples of $25) in either low risk (6-9%) or high risk (10-25%) . I&#39;ve chosen to automatically invest $25 in all high risk opportunities, and try to match my contribution interval to not have too much money in the account. Once the contribution windows gets too long (ie 4 weeks or more), I&#39;ll up investment amount to $50 per investment. Its good to have some spare money sitting in the account, as some loan requirements are satisfied almost immediately</p><p>If you&#39;d like to invest with Lending Loop, please use my referral link <a href=\"https://www.lendingloop.ca/?code=0e40f4\">https://www.lendingloop.ca/?code=0e40f4</a>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#39;ll try to post updates of my progress at regular intervals</p>", image_file_name: "lending_loop.png", image_content_type: "image/png", image_file_size: 77626, image_updated_at: "2017-09-17 22:37:42", state: 1, publish_date: nil},

While I put this off for a long time, because I convinced byself I would merely circumvent the block when I wanted to view the site, this really helped. Somehow having the site return as blocked was enough to snap me back to what I needed to do. Keep your PC work environment clear of distracting programs you should not be using, and make them more difficult to access. Surprisingly, its much easier to convince your mind to not do something if you add extra steps required to do it.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><br></p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><strong>2) Make Lists</strong></p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><span>A list of tasks with an approximate timeline will encourage you to stay on task</span>If you don't have something specific you wish to accomplish in a particular time, its easy to get distracted.

You lose tremendus productivity by context switching</p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><br></p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><strong>4) Remove Automated Distractions</strong></p><p class=\"fr-tag\">Unless the work involves your Email, do not check E-mails between bounded time windows, and don't have your Email client automatically refresh incoming mail.

  {title: "6 Investment mistakes to avoid", category_id: 7, user_id: 1, tags: "", body: "<p>Each one of these are mistakes that have cost me various amounts of money over the course of my life. If I could impart onto you some things not to do when investing, this would be some things from my experience.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">1) Putting all your eggs in one basket</span></strong></p><p>Before the financial crisis, real estate in Alberta was booming, and my Dad and I were trying to get a piece of the action. Not really understanding enough about the company we were investing with, we made a real estate investment that involved developing some land in the Crowsnest Pass to be vacation real estate. While this investment had many problems in retrospect (the Crowsnest Pass is not the hotbed of tourism as places actually in the rockies, the company was a ponzi scheme which took investor&#39;s money and funneled it to previous projects which were not paid for yet, and that vacation real estate is highly volatile), the biggest problem is entirely of our own making. We invested far too much of our assets into a single investment. The promised returns were good, but many businesses lent to by <a href=\"http://www.jonathanweyermann.com/posts/10\">lending loop</a> offer very similar returns, and you can diversify your investments among many businesses. We were pretty much going all in, and we lost nearly everything.</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">2</span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">) Chasing the daily returns of the forex or stock market</span></strong></p><p>No matter which secret formula I purchased from so-called gurus, I couldn&#39;t successfully make profits chasing the markets using technical indicators. Perhaps there are some who can, but it&#39;s a lot harder than it looks. If someone could teach it you using a couple indicators for $49, or even $1049, almost anyone could do it. For a while I bought various systems to try to trade, and all I was doing was spending money on systems and losing money in trading accounts</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">3) purchasing automatic trading tools</span></strong></p><p>Again, if there was a way to consistently profit in the stock market, using binary options, or forex (foreign exchange), would someone really sell it to you for $149? Most robots are scalpers or martingale systems, which often appear to make small profits, but will eventually take massive losses in the long term. Making a successful automated system isn&#39;t easy, as adding more rules (just like in any trading system) doesn&#39;t necessarily make the system better. Markets change too, and what was successful in the past often doesn&#39;t work today. If someone offers you a system that guarantees automatic profits, run away as fast as you can.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">4) Buying or selling options ahead of company earnings to make quick profits</span></strong></p><p>Trading options for a such a short term window is highly speculative. Options can be part of balanced portfolio to hedge losses, and can be used to increase your trading leverage over the medium to long-term, but the movement of stock after earnings can be highly irrational. Stocks can move down on good news, for instance. Often purchasing options can produce losses if the stock doesn&#39;t move far enough in the desired direction, as the volatility decreases after the earning announcement, making the option much less valuable. Selling option can be lucrative before earnings, until you hit a really big move, and you have massive losses. I initially lost several thousand before I realized trading earnings through options is a sucker&#39;s game, because the implied value of out of money options will greatly decrease after earnings.</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">5) Making investment decisions based on the day to day news of companies and speculations thereof</span></strong></p><p>Successful investors don&#39;t let the daily company news scare them, but are in it for the long haul. Speculations about production problems of the iPhone 8 isn&#39;t going to make long-term AAPL investors flinch, for instance. While following company news and technical charts can be exciting, if it causes you to touch your investments, it&#39;s probably not a good thing. Time in the stock market is usually more important than trying to time the market. Also, if every time you hear bad news you buy the stock&#39;s put options to safeguard from losing, you&#39;ll lose by default because you&#39;ve paid for so much premium that it erodes your gains. Seemingly every week someone has a theory on why a stock will decline, and they&#39;re usually wrong. Same with the market as a whole. As they say, experts have predicted 23 out of the last 3 market crashes...&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">6) Using mutual funds to invest</span></strong></p><p>This one could easily be most people&#39;s costliest mistake over their lifetime. Like many others, &nbsp;I diligently invested in mutual funds, &nbsp;not fully understanding the management expense ratio of about 1.86% I was paying. In fact the average management expense ratio in Canada is 2.35%. <a href=\"http://www.advisor.ca/news/industry-news/investment-fees-cost-canadians-hundreds-of-thousands-209317\">This could cost you hundreds of thousands over the course of your life</a>, &nbsp;as every year 2.35% of your portfolio is lost to fees. The solution is to use a self directed account and purchase the much more cost-effective ETFs (exchange trades funds). I use <a href=\"http://www.questrade.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Questrade</a>, which doesn&#39;t charge a commission to buy ETFs.

At the very basic level it is a <a href=\"16\">pomodoro</a> tracking tool. It even sounds like a tomato timer. But it&#39;s so much more than that. It allows you to plan tasks in multiple categories and split them into Pomodoro. It allows you to assign an estimated number of pomodoro to a task which you can change at any time. Unlike other pomodoro tools i&#39;ve tried, it doesn&#39;t try to limit your pomodoros per task to 6 or 7 before splitting it up, and this gives a lot more flexibility if you wish to group certain kinds of tasks into one.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">Another thing I love about it is the reports feature. It allows one to review the number of pomodoros done in the past, and shows a very pretty graph. There is limit to far back you can go, and it is thus easy to assess and track your progress.&nbsp;It encourages me to try for more pomodoro to break previous weekly or daily records.&nbsp;A key feature of the pomodoro is that distracting thoughts or tasks are to be written down for later, and teamviz allows for that as well.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">TeamViz is not without some faults however. The most glaring is that the android version is completely unreliable. Typically it will crash before the timer is up, and thus i&#39;ve given up its use altogether. The desktop version are generally stable, but they do have the occasional graphical glitch. For instance, the program can&#39;t display pomodoro past 99 on the main interface window, and the rows of pomodoro on the timer window tends to run off the screen.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">Nevertheless, it is the best combined pomodoro/overall project tracker that i know of. Typically it takes two programs to accomplish what TeamViz does, and I find that too cumbersome to be practical.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\">At this point all the features seem to be free, although the <a href=\"http://www.teamviz.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">company website</a> states that the synchronization is actually $1.99 a month. If this ever got enforced, I would have to upgrade, as its a must have feature, as TeamViz runs on all of my computers, on both windows and ubuntu, and without the synchronzie feature it would lose a lot of its appeal.</p><p class=\"fr-tag\"><br></p>", image_file_name: "TeamViz.png", image_content_type: "image/png", image_file_size: 256144, image_updated_at: "2015-03-13 03:30:04", state: 1, publish_date: nil},

There are perhaps 20 billion like our sun, with perhaps 1/5th of them with earth-like planets in their habitable zone - where life could exist. If 0.1% of these had life, there would be 1 million planets with life. &nbsp;This leads to an important question</p><p>Where are all the aliens?</p><p>It gets even worse when you recognize that the sun is much younger than many of the other stars in the galaxy, billions of years, in fact. Life on other planets around other stars in the milky way could have conceivably existed for more than 7 billion years before the earth was even formed. Even if one of these had become a space travelling super civilization we would have noticed by now. &nbsp;This is because an advanced alien species should be able to to colonize the galaxy in matter of 2 million years or less, &nbsp;assuming a slow, &nbsp;but exponential expansion.</p><p>This question regarding the apparent contradiction of the age abd vastness of space versus its apparent emptiness is called the Fermi paradox</p><p><br></p><p>The Great Filter</p><p>Some have speculated that there must be some point along their evolution that species were prevented from progressing.

Perhaps they have a prime directive, like in star trek. Or they don&#39;t interact, just like we don&#39;t interact with insects. Or they just hide, but then wipe anyone out once they reach a sufficiently advanced level of technology. &nbsp;Maybe colonizing the galaxy just isn&#39;t the goal when you get to that level of technology</p><p>Or maybe there is this chance, however remote, that we&#39;re the most advanced species currently in the galaxy, a blue dot all alone in the vast emptiness of space. &nbsp;Perhaps we will never know in our lifetime.

  {title: "My 5 top tips to becoming a better software developer", category_id: 8, user_id: 1, tags: "Software Development", body: "<p><strong>1. Hold in tension how many questions to ask you fellow developers</strong></p><p>You&#39;ll never truly understand something if you always ask your fellow developers after the first signs of trouble. Commit to spending some time understanding something new before you ask for help. If something can be solved with a simple Google search, you should definitely not be asking your fellow developers. You should also attempt to use your debugging tools, like logging and breakpoints to look for the root cause of an issue. While an expert on your team may be able to solve the problem quicker this time, having the result handed to you can stunt your growth and limit your own learning. This doesn&#39;t mean you should never ask for help however. If you can&#39;t make any progress on something for what seems like an unreasonably long time, it can better to ask just to get moving in your current project, but keep in mind that this reduces your own growth as a developer&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Keep the big picture in mind and uncover more problems sooner</strong></p><p>Mostly its advantageous to bump into all the issues with a project as fast as possible, <span style=\"background-color: initial;\">even if it means working on multiple parts of the project without finishing them. For instance, as a web developer, &nbsp;there is no point optimizing the code or styling the first page in a web funnel if you interact with external APIs in the next few steps for which you rely on another team. Try to bump into the edges your your system, where you interact with the outside world as quickly as possible. If there is an issue, it&#39;s better the other team knows as soon as possible. It&#39;s important identity things in your project that you may rely on a third party for first, so you can give others the most amount of time to respond and address the issue. In the meantime, you will have lots of time to refactoring your code, add caching and optimizations, and increase your test coverage. </span></p><p>This also applies to problems you run into on your own. Instead of letting something hold you up for a long time because you don&#39;t know how to elegantly solve it, do what you have to to move past the problem for now. Your unconscious mind may help you come up with a solution when you least expect it. Treat your keyboard time preciously, &nbsp;and leverage your mind while away from the computer <span style=\"background-color: initial;\">by bumping into as many difficult issues as you can while at the computer.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Always leave the code base better than how you found it</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t ultimately aim for the quickest solution when committing to a code base, &nbsp;but always try to write code in a way that makes structural sense. You and your fellow developers may be maintaining and adding to a codebase for a long time, so it&#39;s important that the code is easy to follow, &nbsp;the methods are short and appropriately named and thus easy to understand by yourself and others in the future. Less is more in software development, so if you can reduce the amount of code in your codebase by refactoring out common code and put it in modules, superclasses and gems(libraries), you should. However, don&#39;t immediately try remove any and all duplication. If it&#39;s not apparent to you which method of code abstraction you should use, &nbsp;remember that duplication is still better than using the wrong abstraction. Also, don&#39;t reinvent the wheel: if functionality you need can be found in an external library, you&#39;re mostly better of using that than writing extra code yourself.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. Automate and Abstract whenever you can</strong></p><p>This should be applied at many levels. You should set up your system so applications are running without maintenance, and abstract away long, &nbsp;complex command line commands with bash aliases. There is no point memorizing something your machine can memorize for you. If you find yourself performing a lot of tasks that should be repeatable, it can often be better to write a script or a code module that will allow you to perform the same action in the future if it comes up. Once checked into your version control system with some high level documentation, your fellow developers will be able to benefit from your work for a long time. People should not have to look through your code to know how to use it. You should always be looking for ways to simplify and abstract away unnecessary complex and tedious tasks.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Write code that doesn&#39;t need documentation</strong></p><p>Documentation adds another layer that must match the code that you must maintain. &nbsp;It can get out of date, &nbsp;or cause conflicts in your version management system. It&#39;s better to write the code in a way that is self-explanatory. To achieve this, reduce the length of methods you create, and accurately name the methods, &nbsp;describing what they do. If a class does something non-obvious besides its described function, it may be be better to extract that functionality and put it in its own class or module. Finally, ensure you place methods in classes where they make sense. &nbsp;Each file your write should represent a class or object. &nbsp;If methods are like the messages sent to that class or object, ensure that the messages are something you would expect the object to do. If a method makes no sense in the context of a particular object, &nbsp;maybe it should be in a different object.&nbsp;</p>", image_file_name: "apps.jpg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 385364, image_updated_at: "2017-10-22 17:48:43", state: 1, publish_date: "2017-10-31 00:00:00"},

  {title: "The compounding principle and the power of habit", category_id: 4, user_id: 1, tags: "", body: "<p>While it can be easy to see how money can compound given enough time, as its just fairly simple mathematics, admittedly with some assumptions, it can be more difficult to see and get excited about the impact of consistently and habit, &nbsp;and the compounding effect it can have on your life.&nbsp;</p><p>If you were to take even $100/week and invest it in the stock market, after 10 years you would have about $80000, after 20 years $252000 and after 30 years $640000. This is both due to the weekly investing and the compounding. This is easy in a sense because you can do it automatically, and while the growth is slow, it is easy to measure.</p><p>When it comes to other aspects of life, such as learning a skill, your career, your health, &nbsp;relationships, hobbies, &nbsp;contributions to society and overall happiness, measuring becomes much more difficult. However, I still believe it can be measured. And if it can be measured, it can be improved. Just like the stock market, these things don&#39;t go up in a straight line, and you may have setbacks, and your knowledge may plateau, but over the course of many months and years, &nbsp;things should generally improve. Just like with the stock market, &nbsp;you must make regular deposits, investments of time to grow the other aspects of your life, &nbsp;or they just happen to you and you will make little progress.</p><p>If you want to improve your health, &nbsp;for instance, you don&#39;t start by running a marathon and then consider health accomplished and never run again. Starting off too strong is a sure way to get burnt out. Instead, realize that you have 168 hours a week and 52 weeks a year. If you commit to just half an hour a day to anything, &nbsp;you will have committed 180 hours a year, or nearly 5 work weeks to it. That&#39;s enough to run the distance of 40 marathons, even if you start off at a really slow pace. &nbsp;It&#39;s enough time to read 20 books, or start and maintain a blog, &nbsp;or write a short book, or learn and improve a number of skills.</p><p>The key is to use the power of habit, and public accountability to become better at something that&#39;s hard for you normally. Often, &nbsp;just like investment, &nbsp;it&#39;s best to pay yourself first. You may spend a 8-10 hours a day at work, after which you may find it difficult to focus on what you should be doing to improve yourself in other ways. Perhaps if you find it hard to exercise, you should get up each morning and spend the first number of minutes walking, running or doing aerobic exercise. It does not have to be long, it doesn&#39;t have to be intense, but given enough time, you will become better at it. Consistency is key here, and his better than intensity.&nbsp;</p><p>So how can you force yourself to be consistent?&nbsp;</p><p>1) Set aside time that&#39;s guaranteed to be yours. This may be in the morning before work, late at night before bed, at lunch, or just after work, &nbsp;whatever time you can guarantee you won&#39;t be interrupted in.</p><p>2) find a time to make up if you do get interrupted, either internally or externally&nbsp;</p><p>3) create a visual reminder, &nbsp;preferably where you and others can see it. &nbsp;Putting an X through each day in a calendar is a good any to do it. This works even if you don&#39;t do it every day. Even if your goal it to be done 3 times a week, &nbsp;you should try to pick your days, and have backup days you can fall back on.&nbsp;</p><p>4) Calculate and anticipate the potential benefits 1, 5, 10, 20, 30 years down the road, but don&#39;t dwell on the long term goal, but find a way to do each day to get closer to the prize.&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: initial;\">Focus on the process, not the goal. Even if you just spend time each day without seemingly discrete progress, you will move towards your goals</span></p><p>5) measure your progress, but not too frequently. If the goal is to lose weight, &nbsp;don&#39;t jump on the scale every day, &nbsp;but every two weeks at most. Your weight fluctuates daily, and you won&#39;t be able to measure daily progress. If you want to measure your ability at a particular skill or success in a business, the measuring interval may be a month, or quarterly. All you need is a set of metrics you can compare from interval to interval. While it seems like this is a long time to see progress, in retrospect you will be amazed at all you have accomplished by your consistency.</p>", image_file_name: nil, image_content_type: nil, image_file_size: nil, image_updated_at: nil, state: 1, publish_date: "2017-11-21 00:00:00"},
  {title: "Creating vs Consumption and Happiness", category_id: 9, user_id: 1, tags: "", body: "<p>Are producers of content (writing, music, TV, video games, software) happier than those who consume it? Does happiness come from consuming content, or producing it? Some would argue that people who only consume content are watching, listening or reading about others living their lives, &nbsp;whereas producers are actually living it. For instance, hockey players or actors are working and producing &#39;content&#39;, &nbsp;getting paid for what they love to do, &nbsp;whereas many of us just passively observe them, in what is probably the lowest and most braindead of activity.&nbsp;</p><p>I think we need both to be happy. Sometimes you may just want to indulge and watch your favorite series, sport or play a video game. This brings happiness in the moment, &nbsp;and for a time afterwards. It can even be a great shared experience that allows you to bond with others. After a hard day&#39;s work, often all that may be left is the desire just to be a consumer, &nbsp;whether it be food or entertainment. Consuming content is definitely easier than producing content, &nbsp;especially materials of the quality others would want to consume.&nbsp;</p><p>To truly achieve long term happiness, &nbsp;producing content is much more meaningful, especially if many people benefit from it. This second point is sometimes the issue with producing content. &nbsp;You can put things out there, &nbsp;but getting other people to consume it can be difficult. You should not let that discourage you. If you want to be a writer, a speaker, a designer, a developer, athlete or an actor, you should be willing to do all those things regardless of your audience. Passion for these things must long precede success, for without it, &nbsp;you will give up long before any success comes.</p><p>The advent of social media has given many of us an audience for our content. &nbsp;But are we actually contributing anything meaningful or helpful to someone else? Many of us just use social media to build up an image of ourselves, &nbsp;to make us feel better by sharing our most noteworthy moments in life. It even seems like a financially successful strategy for some, sharing images of themselves on instagram. While it may be a good way to gather an audience, I think eventually it would be more fulfilling to be using it as a platform for our art or our writing, to contribute something meaningful to teach, &nbsp;mentor and lift up other people.</p><p>Besides fulfillment, creation of content has many benefits. It fosters critical thought, requiring one to succinctly express thoughts, &nbsp;synthesize knowledge from multiple sources and confidently express researched opinions. It requires knowledge far above the level of consumption. Teaching others your knowledge takes your own understanding of your craft to the next level.&nbsp;</p><p>Most meaningful jobs require the creation of something. Whether it&#39;s a physical product, &nbsp;lesson plans, reports, spreadsheets or code, being an succinct, efficient creator is a valuable skill. While you may view this as obvious, and are more than willing to exchange your time to create something of value at work, the true test is to create something where the monetary reward isn&#39;t immediately obvious, and no one is monitoring you.&nbsp;</p><p>Being able and willing to create something outside of what is required of you at work not only makes one more valued and desired by employers, but also more capable in a self-employed capacity, &nbsp;being more equipped to offer others value directly, &nbsp;without hiding behind an employer. Aside from investing money you already have, and relying on your employer, &nbsp;it is another path to freedom. Having many customers, viewer or clients has its benefits over a single employers, but it is also a more difficult path, at least initially. It can give you flexibility in terms of where and when you work, but can also force you to be always available. Creating for others as an employee, and merely consuming in your spare time, is definitely the path of least resistance. &nbsp;Does it ultimately being happiness, &nbsp;or does that require carving our own path in life? I think we are all different, &nbsp;and we each have to choose what we think is the best path for ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>In future posts, I will focus on how to find your area of contribution, how to stay motivated, how to find time to become a content creator.

There are many roadblocks and excuses people can use to prevent themselves from making progress, or to stick with it if they don&#39;t seem to be making headway right away. Perhaps you don&#39;t have a lot of free time, or feel like you have little to contribute. Here are some of the tips I&#39;ve found that help me to gain some traction.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>1) Just start </strong></p><p>Finding a topic can me the most difficult, but each of us is unique in some ways. We each have our own interests and perspectives on things, and have some sort of knowledge others may benefits from. If often helps just to write your preliminary thought down, even if you cant think of a title, are not sure how you will organize it or how everything will go together. It&#39;s important to remember that you&#39;re not publishing the first things you&#39;re writing down: You can change what you write repeatedly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2) Give yourself lots of writing opportunities</strong></p><p>Even if you don&#39;t have much free time on your hands, you probably have some. Personally, I find i&#39;m more likely to make progress on a blog post if I have the opportunity to write any time of day by using my smart phone to write. I often have little chunks of time where I could be writing, but tend to gravitate towards browsing the internet. Some of you may find it helpful to write notes on paper as ideas come to you. If you wait until you get to sit in front of a computer to write, you may forget ideas you have, and unless you manage to find consistent time to do so, your writing opportunities may be sparse</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3) if you struggle to release content, force yourself to stick to a specific release schedule</strong></p><p>Consistency is more important that perfection. You can&#39;t be afraid to share your thoughts with the world. If your platform supports it, &nbsp;set a release date on a predefined interval for all blogs that you&#39;re working on (I&#39;m doing weekly) . Doing this actually forced me to finish a post, &nbsp;instead of just starting a number of posts without ever finishing them. While you may not have a large audience early on, &nbsp;and posts are not necessarily permanent once they&#39;re released, this nevertheless forces you to make a post release-worthy. For other types of creative &nbsp;pursuits, this may be more difficult, &nbsp;unless you can create some sort of public accountability for you getting your work done. If your projects come in smaller, discrete chunks, &nbsp;such as YouTube videos, similar ideas can work, &nbsp;but if you&#39;re writing a book, &nbsp;it may be difficult for others to keep you accountable for your progress. Therefore, unless you are very motivated, it will be easier to blog or vlog than to write a book.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4) Find reasons to stick to it that give you motivation</strong></p><p>There are many motivations you may have for writing a blog, &nbsp;or a vlog, &nbsp;or producing some sort of content or creating software. &nbsp;If you write these down, &nbsp;you may be more willing to keep going when you don&#39;t see result away.

The setup steps will still require us to create the EC2, connect to the EC2 and configure Nginx, set up Postgres (done on the same server for now) and start passenger. To deploy your own app, you will need to use capistrano in your rails app, or clone the image onto the server from github</p><p><br></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">A) Spin up the EC2</span></strong></p><p><br></p><p>1) go to the EC2 section, click instances, and &#39;Launch Instance&#39;</p><p>2) Click &#39;Community AMIs&#39;</p><p>3) Search for &#39;Ruby on Rails&#39;</p><p>4) Choose &#39;webapp_nginx_rails_passenger&#39;</p><p>5) pick t2.micro (or something larger if you want, but t2.micro is the free tier)</p><p>6) if it&#39;s the only instance you&#39;ll be running on this account, you can click &#39;Review and Launch&#39;, otherwise make sure it&#39;s in the VPC you want. You can configure storage options and a host of other details if you wish, but it&#39;s not necessary.</p><p>7) Click Launch, select &#39;Create a new key pair&#39;, and enter a key pair name, and download the keypair - be sure to keep this file, as you will need it to access your instance by ssh. You can now click Launch to launch the instance.</p><p>8) go back the EC2 main page, click &#39;instances&#39; and you should see your running instance (or see it getting ready, at least)</p><p>9) click on your instance, find your security group and click on it to modify it, and click &#39;inbound&#39;</p><p>10) ensure it looks like this, otherwise click edit and add rules</p><table><thead><tr><th>Type<br></th><th>Protocol<br></th><th>Port Range<br></th><th>Source<br></th><th>Description<br></th></tr></thead><tfoot><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><br></td></tr></tfoot><tbody><tr><td>HTTP<br></td><td>TCP<br></td><td>80<br></td><td>0.0.0.0/0<br></td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>SSH<br></td><td>TCP<br></td><td>22<br></td><td>0.0.0.0/0<br></td></tr></tbody></table><p>You will want to add HTTP access to port 80 from &#39;everywhere&#39;</p><p>11) In the EC2 main page, look for the VPC id of your instance (something like vpc-61348706) and then go to the vpc section, click the vpc your ec2 was launched in, click Actions, Edit DNS Hostnames, and select &#39;Yes&#39;. This will allow you to view your instances -Public DNS (IPv4) address. You can now go back to your ec2, and copy the Public DNS address (the format is something like <a href=\"http://ec2-35-133-139-01.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\">ec2-35-133-139-01.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com</a></p><p data-empty=\"true\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><br></span></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">B) Accessing your instance and reverse proxying nginx</span></strong></p><p><br></p><p>1) open a terminal window &nbsp;(if you&#39;re using Windows, use <a href=\"http://www.putty.org/\">PuTTy</a> to ssh) and and add your keypair (for example, if you called the keypair &#39;demo&#39; and placed it in ~/.ssh, the command would be&nbsp;</p><pre><code>chmod 400 ~/.ssh/demo.pem\r\nssh-add  ~/.ssh/demo.pem\r\n</code></pre><p>The first command reduces your permissions to make the pem file valid to use, while the second command adds it to your ssh keys&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>2) you should now be able to access the instance with using the ec2-user and the public DNS</p><pre><code>ssh ec2-user@ec2-35-133-139-01.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\r\n</code></pre><p><br></p><p>3) set up nginx</p><p>once on the server, type to open vim to configure the nginx.conf file</p><pre><code>sudo vi /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf\r\n</code></pre><p><br></p><p>inside the server brackets, add</p><pre><code>location / {\r\n\r\nproxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000/;\r\nproxy_http_version 1.1;\r\nproxy_set_header Host $http_host;\r\nproxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\r\nproxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;\r\nproxy_buffering off;\r\n</code></pre><p><br></p><p>4) start nginx</p><pre><code>sudo service nginx start\r\n</code></pre><p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><br></span></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">C) Configuring Postgres and starting the Passenger Server</span></strong></p><p><br></p><p>There is a small sample app that comes with the image - deploying your own app will be covered in a future tutorial.

  {title: "Why you should save and invest as if you were retiring early", category_id: 7, user_id: 1, tags: "", body: "<p>Even if you love your current job, or you don&#39;t think early retirement is for you, because you love the idea of working in general, there are arguments to be made for saving and investing as if you were to retire early.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1) you may change your mind</strong></p><p>Even if you&#39;re early in your career, and you love your job, you may not feel the same way 15, or even 30 years from now. Saving as if you were going to retire gives you options. Once you spend the money, your options will always be diminished. Unless you&#39;re confident of your life&#39;s paths and you&#39;re spending towards it, saving and investing your money defers having to make a decision for your future now</p><p><strong>2) Your future earnings may not be entirely in your control</strong></p><p>Steady, &nbsp;reliable, &nbsp;long-term employment seems to be becoming harder to come by today. &nbsp;Work seems to be becoming increasingly automated, &nbsp;and people, &nbsp;if needed at all, &nbsp;become part-time cogs in the machine. Even if you have reliable employment with a pension, what Is to say that you want to tie yourself to that company, &nbsp;or that it will be around long enough to pay your pension? You may desire to adjust your lifestyle to be more flexible, by becoming a freelancer or running a business, &nbsp;but your income may thus not be as reliable. &nbsp;Thus, &nbsp;if your require most of your income to live your lifestyle and save little, &nbsp;you will be stuck to your job.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3) Compounded growth in the early years can set up you for life</strong></p><p>Most people save for retirement backwards. They contribute little early in their careers, and more as they get older. But from pure numbers perspective it doesn&#39;t make sense. Contributions made earlier have much more time to compound, &nbsp;requiring only minimum contributions later on if you desire to go the traditional retirement route. If you even lived saving 50% percent of your income for the first 5 years, and didn&#39;t touch it or add to it until a normal retirement age, you could easily have an additional million to retire on.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4) it gives your life focus and discipline</strong></p><p>Spending less forces you to make decisions about your priorities. Your decisions will be less about which toy you wish to buy next, &nbsp;but more about the direction you wish your life to take. You will be forced to discover happiness outside of consumption, and to really distinguish needs from wants.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5) it gives you the freedom to pursue your dreams</strong></p><p>If you don&#39;t need money, you have the freedom to create whatever pursuits you like. You can do whatever you want, even if it does not pay much or anything at all.&nbsp; You can volunteer with a pursuit you actually consider meaningful. You can travel where you want,&nbsp; when you want. You can study what you want, when you want,&nbsp; if you want. You can learn a new language by living in the country it&#39;s spoken.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>", image_file_name: nil, image_content_type: nil, image_file_size: nil, image_updated_at: nil, state: nil, publish_date: "2017-12-12 00:00:00"},

  {title: "Ingredients to early financial independence", category_id: 7, user_id: 1, tags: "", body: "<p>While for most the idea of early financial independence or retirement may only be a dream, I believe it is within the realm of possibility for many. There is no question that it requires some sacrifices and tradeoffs, &nbsp;but I believe that these are worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some of the ingredients for early financial independence&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1) spend less than you earn, much less</strong></p><p>The more you save and invest, the earlier you will reach financial independence. This is because you not only save more when you spend less, you require less resources to be financially independent. If you&#39;re used to living on less, and thus your costs are lower, you will also need less in retirement. A good post to explain this can be found <a href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/\">here</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>2) Invest in yourself through education</strong></p><p>It is extremely difficult to retire early if your income is really low. There are some minimum expenses that are difficult to avoid, without which living requires too much sacrifice. For instance, you&#39;ll need somewhere to live, &nbsp;regardless if you decide to rent or buy. Unless you&#39;re business savvy, &nbsp;it&#39;s going to be hard to make sufficient income without some form of education. Learning a trade works too. Education isn&#39;t necessarily something you do at school, but is a lifelong process.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3) Get your partner on board </strong></p><p>Regardless if how much you earn, it&#39;s not going result in financial independence if your partner is not on board. This has more to do with philosophy than earnings. If your partner doesn&#39;t believe in saving for the future as much as you do, they will expect earnings to be spent on the conveniences of today, and it will be difficult to put away enough money to retire early.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4) invest early, &nbsp;invest often, don&#39;t pay too many fees</strong></p><p>The safest way to invests is to frequently purchase broad market index funds through ETFs which have low fees. You get the benefit of diversification and cost averaging, &nbsp;and you avoid paying someone a large chunk of money to invest. You don&#39;t try to predict the market, but frequently add to your positions regardless if the market goes up or down</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p><p>These will help, but are definitely not mandatory.&nbsp;</p><p>I) owning your own home</p><p>Over the long term, &nbsp;this is a significant hedge against inflation at least. While it may not seem like a slam dunk before its paid off, rent keep going up over the long haul, &nbsp;and never goes away. While it can be somewhat cheaper initially, eventually the cost of renting will go up, &nbsp;whereas the amount you owe on a mortgage goes down, and the payment is less of a burden due to inflation (wages rise, but cost of rent will rise with it)&nbsp;</p><p>II) owning a rental property or two</p><p>Assuming you get a good deal on it and it&#39;s at least somewhat cash flow positive, the return on your initial down-payment can be much higher than you may get in the stock market due to the leverage of borrowed money. &nbsp;This is not without some work though. While investing in the stock market can be done completely passively, real estate is not without some required work. Also, it&#39;s unlikely you will make money on it if you outsource the property management. At the very least, &nbsp;you will give up a large chunk of your profits</p><p>III) have a side hustle</p><p>Whether it&#39;s an online business, a traditional business or you freelance or consult, or you have a blog or drive a taxi, a side gig can give you some additional income to accelerate your investment gains.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>", image_file_name: nil, image_content_type: nil, image_file_size: nil, image_updated_at: nil, state: nil, publish_date: "2018-01-16 00:00:00"},
  {title: "7 Reasons to write a blog", category_id: 4, user_id: 1, tags: "", body: "<p><strong>1) To learn</strong></p><p>To really be an expert in your field, it helps to be able to express yourself and explain your skills to others. Forcing yourself to explain a concept to someone encourages your to get a firmer grasp of it yourself.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2) To provide value</strong></p><p>As an expert, or at least someone with some experience in a field, you help others on a similar path in life, or with similar interests. By reading your blog, other may painful mistakes you had to go through, and be able to reach their goals much sooner. While there are many ways to make profit on the internet, offering value of some kind is almost a prerequisite.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3) To document </strong></p><p>By writing a blog, you will document a lot of the knowledge you may only have in your head. Doing so will force you to write it down, creating additional clarity for yourself and others. The blog not only helps others then, but serves as an organized repository of information that allows you to track your goals and keep a record of your own thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4) To make money</strong></p><p>Making money, especially residual and passive income can be a key motivator for writing a blog. Some of my favourite financial blogs, such as <a href=\"//mymoneymustache.com\">mymoneymustache.com</a> or <a href=\"//financialsamurai.com\">financialsamurai.com</a> net their owners hundreds of thousands a year. Both sites are well established, and the owners still make a lot of income even when they don&#39;t put a lot of work into the site. Blogging is pretty much the ultimate business, as capital costs are minimal, and one can work from anywhere. That said, like any business, it requires discipline, and success is not guaranteed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5) To leave a legacy</strong></p><p>Like any business, a blog is something you may wish to pass onto your children. Depending on its success, it may be carried forward by your family, leaving something yourself behind upon your death. If you don&#39;t achieve any success with it, keeping it operational after your death may be difficult, as keeping websites up in perpetuity without an owner is a problem yet to be solved, though I&#39;m sure will be solved in the near Future</p><p><br></p><p><strong>6) To foster discipline</strong></p><p>Having some sort of accountability to someone, even if it&#39;s just a few readers over the internet, encourages you to be a more consistant writer. Moreover, if you track any kind of goals on your blog, be it the loss of weight, elimination of debt, or your net worth, sharing it with others will force you to stick to your goals more readily</p><p><br></p><p><strong>7) To build a presence online</strong></p><p>Even if your financial success due to your blog is limited, you will increase your presence online. You can showcase your work and your knowledge, and thus be more likely to land freelance gigs, find a new job, consulting work or speaking gigs, or whatever floats your boat.&nbsp;</p>", image_file_name: "gatekeeper-vpc-setup.jpg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 44772, image_updated_at: "2017-11-10 15:16:33", state: nil, publish_date: "2018-01-02 00:00:00"}
